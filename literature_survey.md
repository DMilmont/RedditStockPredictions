Wisdom of Crowds: The Value of Stock Opinions Transmitted Through Social Media
https://www.hedgechatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wisdom-of-crowds.pdf

Social media has become a popular venue for individuals to share the results of their own
analysis on financial securities. This paper investigates the extent to which investor
opinions transmitted through social media predict future stock returns and earnings
surprises. By utilizing a social media outlet to examine the value relevance of peer opinions, our study is
perhaps most closely related to those of Tumarkin and Whitelaw (2001), Antweiler and Frank (2004) and
Das and Chen (2007), who examine how conversations on Internet message boards associate with stock
returns. Tumarkin and Whitelaw (2001) detect no association; Das and Chen (2007) find “no strong
relationship from sentiment to stock prices on average across the individual stocks” (page 1385); and
Antweiler and Frank (2004) find a statistically significant, yet economically meaningless, association. 
Together, the results presented in these studies suggest that social media outlets cannot predict stock returns. In sharp contrast, the pattern documented here is both statistically significant and economically
meaningful.

Sentiment analysis on social media for stock movement prediction
https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~s1220203/images/thien_ESWA2015.pdf

In addition to historical prices, the current
stock market is affected by the mood of society. The overall social
mood with respect to a given company might be one of the important
variables which affect the stock price of that company. Nowadays, the
emergence of online social networks makes available large amounts
of mood data. Therefore, incorporating information from social media
with the historical prices can improve the predictive ability of
models. One contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel feature
‘topic-sentiment’ to improve the performance of stock market prediction.
It is important to recognize what topics are discussed in social
media and how people feel about these topics. The ‘topic-sentiment’
feature, which represents the sentiments of the specific topics of the
company (product, service, dividend and so on), are used for prediction
of stock price movement.To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first research trying to extract topics and sentiments simultaneously
and utilize them for stock market prediction.

Stock Prices and Social Dynamics
http://www.econ.yale.edu//~shiller/pubs/p0616.pdf

Investing in speculative assets is a social activity. Investors spend a substantial part of their leisure time discussing investments, reading about investments, or gossiping about others' successes or failures in investing. It is thus plausible that investor's behavior (and hence prices of speculative assets) would be influenced by social movements.

The Fed reported that in 2015, households directly
owned 37.3 percent of corporate equity.11
Households owned another 13 percent indirectly
through mutual funds (and more through ETFs and
CEFs).12 In total, the Fed reported that households
owned more than 50.3 percent of the value of
outstanding U.S. stock.

Survey: Visualization of text sentiment has evolved greatly. From simple bar graphs, pie charts to complex visualization of Textual Entailment and semantic role labeling visuals have proved really helpful on helping us understand 2 things. 1. How and what the machine Learning algorithms understand from the text and 2. How can we use this knowledge to visually represent decisions we take. Some of the visualizations which were discussed in the paper which are worth exploring for our project are 1. Aggregating and visualizing microblogging posts for events exploration, 2. monitoring sentiment associated with certain streams of data such as stocks market in our use case and 3. visualize topics with corresponding opinions and sentiments in social media discussions (reddit in particular).

survey: Similar events are reported differently via news sites which are the traditional method of media and via blogs which is more opinionated. This paper discusses a sentiment aggregation and scoring phase which is effective in understanding the variations of how a certain event would be scored sentimentally via news sources vs social media streams. This is manner, we can use this discussion to see how reddit posts fare sentimentally against an event vs how the traditional news channels absorb the same event. This comparison, I believe can better help in stock prediction.

Survey: Over the last decade micro blogging sites such as twitter, reddit have gained prominance. This greatly reduces the amount of words used to convey a positive or negative sentiment. The survey even uses the analysis on hashtags in twitter to see what sentiments these individual words/phrases convey. Using this idea which was discussed on this paper, our team would try and expand it out to the stock market world where for example certain words such as “bullish”, “bearish”, “losing”, “winning” provide greater understanding of the sentiment the text implies.
