Wisdom of Crowds: The Value of Stock Opinions Transmitted Through Social Media
https://www.hedgechatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wisdom-of-crowds.pdf

Social media has become a popular venue for individuals to share the results of their own
analysis on financial securities. This paper investigates the extent to which investor
opinions transmitted through social media predict future stock returns and earnings
surprises. By utilizing a social media outlet to examine the value relevance of peer opinions, our study is
perhaps most closely related to those of Tumarkin and Whitelaw (2001), Antweiler and Frank (2004) and
Das and Chen (2007), who examine how conversations on Internet message boards associate with stock
returns. Tumarkin and Whitelaw (2001) detect no association; Das and Chen (2007) find “no strong
relationship from sentiment to stock prices on average across the individual stocks” (page 1385); and
Antweiler and Frank (2004) find a statistically significant, yet economically meaningless, association. 
Together, the results presented in these studies suggest that social media outlets cannot predict stock returns. In sharp contrast, the pattern documented here is both statistically significant and economically
meaningful.

Sentiment analysis on social media for stock movement prediction
https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~s1220203/images/thien_ESWA2015.pdf

In addition to historical prices, the current
stock market is affected by the mood of society. The overall social
mood with respect to a given company might be one of the important
variables which affect the stock price of that company. Nowadays, the
emergence of online social networks makes available large amounts
of mood data. Therefore, incorporating information from social media
with the historical prices can improve the predictive ability of
models. One contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel feature
‘topic-sentiment’ to improve the performance of stock market prediction.
It is important to recognize what topics are discussed in social
media and how people feel about these topics. The ‘topic-sentiment’
feature, which represents the sentiments of the specific topics of the
company (product, service, dividend and so on), are used for prediction
of stock price movement.To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first research trying to extract topics and sentiments simultaneously
and utilize them for stock market prediction.

Stock Prices and Social Dynamics
http://www.econ.yale.edu//~shiller/pubs/p0616.pdf

Investing in speculative assets is a social activity. Investors spend a substantial part of their leisure time discussing investments, reading about investments, or gossiping about others' successes or failures in investing. It is thus plausible that investor's behavior (and hence prices of speculative assets) would be influenced by social movements.

The Fed reported that in 2015, households directly
owned 37.3 percent of corporate equity.11
Households owned another 13 percent indirectly
through mutual funds (and more through ETFs and
CEFs).12 In total, the Fed reported that households
owned more than 50.3 percent of the value of
outstanding U.S. stock.

Survey: Visualization of text sentiment has evolved greatly. From simple bar graphs, pie charts to complex visualization of Textual Entailment and semantic role labeling visuals have proved really helpful on helping us understand 2 things. 1. How and what the machine Learning algorithms understand from the text and 2. How can we use this knowledge to visually represent decisions we take. Some of the visualizations which were discussed in the paper which are worth exploring for our project are 1. Aggregating and visualizing microblogging posts for events exploration, 2. monitoring sentiment associated with certain streams of data such as stocks market in our use case and 3. visualize topics with corresponding opinions and sentiments in social media discussions (reddit in particular).


Large-Scale Sentiment Analysis for News and Blogs

survey: Similar events are reported differently via news sites which are the traditional method of media and via blogs which is more opinionated. This paper discusses a sentiment aggregation and scoring phase which is effective in understanding the variations of how a certain event would be scored sentimentally via news sources vs social media streams. This is manner, we can use this discussion to see how reddit posts fare sentimentally against an event vs how the traditional news channels absorb the same event. This comparison, I believe can better help in stock prediction.

Survey: Over the last decade micro blogging sites such as twitter, reddit have gained prominance. This greatly reduces the amount of words used to convey a positive or negative sentiment. The survey even uses the analysis on hashtags in twitter to see what sentiments these individual words/phrases convey. Using this idea which was discussed on this paper, our team would try and expand it out to the stock market world where for example certain words such as “bullish”, “bearish”, “losing”, “winning” provide greater understanding of the sentiment the text implies.

This paper examines a stock prediction model using sentiment analysis from past stock events. Many of the sections in this paper are associated to the goal of our project, including related work, classification, sentiment analysis, and a predication algorithm. Where our project will differ is that this paper used past event data to train a model to predict future stock behavior using Twitter. We will have a different data source and model, however much of this paper should still be useful for our goals.

This paper investigates the impact of financial news articles on stock prices. The authors mined the text from headlines, attempted to classify the articles, and examined the window of time where the news articles would affect stock prices. The methods used in this paper are similar to what we will need to do for our project and should be useful in our research for the project, except we will be using a different source of data, which presents different challenges.

This paper compares what the authors describe as the two main categories of techniques for predicting sock prices – “statistical” and “soft” techniques. Since the goal of our project is to examine how sentiment in social media effects stock price movements, it might be useful to examine other methods of prediction. Implementing some of the techniques described in this paper might be useful as a comparison tool in our project, to determine whether the change in stock price was due to social media sentiment or other factors.

This paper attempts to use news articles to predict stock price fluctuations. The goal of this paper is similar to the goal of our project, but we will be using more modern analytical methods, and social media sentiment instead of news articles. Still, some of the methods, goals and approaches should be applicable. Specifically, the importance of classifying the sentiment of our inputs, as well as demonstrating the effect this has on price movement will be crucial.

Survey Text: This survey has an interesting take on price prediction of crypto currencies based on the volume of tweets vs the actual sentiment of the tweets. The survey argues that the are able to prove that the actual volume of the tweets matter more than that the sentiment the tweets express. The survey builds on top of previous research done around Google Trends Data and predicting macroeconomic data. Building on top of this, we are going to attempt to see how the volume of reddit posts help predict the price movement of stocks rather than sentiment alone.

Survey Text: Users of Microblogging sites usually express their sentiments along with links to news articles upon which their actual sentiment is based on. This paper discusses different AI techniques and machine learning algorithms such as Natural Language Processing, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest 
and their effectiveness in predicting stock market indexes. Our team will attempt to use similar techniques to break down the reddit posts, the links shared in the post and if those links are news articles, try and attempt to run NLP techniques on those news articles as well to arrive at a dependable sentiment score.

Survey Text: Even when investors go long on certain stocks, they will always be happy to build the stocks they are set on for a cheaper price. For this, investors wait for the price of the stock to decrease and buy them. This fluctuation to stock prices is given by various events. While we know that events create volatility of stocks, to predict the degree of volatility helps investors get a better bargain for buying or selling stocks. This survey discuss on how sentiment analysis can help predict market fluctuation which can there by provide better buys and sells to investors.
