Survey: Visualization of text sentiment has evolved greatly. From simple bar graphs, pie charts to complex visualization of Textual Entailment and semantic role labeling visuals have proved really helpful on helping us understand 2 things. 1. How and what the machine Learning algorithms understand from the text and 2. How can we use this knowledge to visually represent decisions we take. Some of the visualizations which were discussed in the paper which are worth exploring for our project are 1. Aggregating and visualizing microblogging posts for events exploration, 2. monitoring sentiment associated with certain streams of data such as stocks market in our use case and 3. visualize topics with corresponding opinions and sentiments in social media discussions (reddit in particular).

survey: Similar events are reported differently via news sites which are the traditional method of media and via blogs which is more opinionated. This paper discusses a sentiment aggregation and scoring phase which is effective in understanding the variations of how a certain event would be scored sentimentally via news sources vs social media streams. This is manner, we can use this discussion to see how reddit posts fare sentimentally against an event vs how the traditional news channels absorb the same event. This comparison, I believe can better help in stock prediction.

Sentiment analysis of short informal texts

Survey: Over the last decade micro blogging sites such as twitter, reddit have gained prominance. This greatly reduces the amount of words used to convey a positive or negative sentiment. The survey even uses the analysis on hashtags in twitter to see what sentiments these individual words/phrases convey. Using this idea which was discussed on this paper, our team would try and expand it out to the stock market world where for example certain words such as “bullish”, “bearish”, “losing”, “winning” provide greater understanding of the sentiment the text implies.
