```{r warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

```

Data from big query obtained with this:
SELECT * FROM `fh-bigquery.reddit_posts.2018_05` where subreddit = 'wallstreetbets';
SELECT * FROM [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2018_05] WHERE subreddit = 'wallstreetbets'

This will combine all the csv files in the folder structure
```{r}
file_names_comments <- dir('./comments/') #where you have your files
file_names_posts <- dir('./posts/') #where you have your files

setwd("C:/Users/Dave/6242Project/RedditComments/comments")
comments <- do.call(rbind,lapply(file_names_comments,read.csv))
setwd("C:/Users/Dave/6242Project/RedditComments/posts")
posts <- do.call(rbind,lapply(file_names_posts,read.csv))
```



comments and posts can be joined on id as primary key 

Each post has a css_class name which is basically a tag for the type of post. We should only focus on the good tags. Something like "shitpost" contains what it says, shit.

We should only look at posts with the following tags: futures, options, yolo, earnings, loss, fundamentals, question, stocks, technicals, daily, dd, and profit. 

Unfortunately the majority of posts are not tagged, and there appears to be a high average score. This may indicate that tagging did not start until recently. 
```{r}

#tagged categories ordered by avgscore and count
posts %>% 
  group_by(link_flair_css_class) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(),
            avgScore = mean(score)
            ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avgScore,count))

```

fixing column types
add link_id to posts with t3_ concat to match format of id in comments. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/65wb9a/combining_reddit_comments_and_posts_in_the_reddit/
```{r}
posts <- posts %>% 
  mutate(id = as.character(id),
         from_id = as.character(from_id),
         link_id = paste("t3_",id, sep = "")
         )

comments <- comments %>% 
  mutate(id = as.character(id),
         link_id = as.character(link_id))

```



created_utc timestamp comes as a unix timestamp in seconds. Clearing this up. Making new column with EST timestamp. 
```{r}
posts <- posts %>% 
  mutate(created_utc_converted = lubridate::as_datetime(created_utc),
         created_date_time_UTC = lubridate::force_tz(created_utc_converted, tzone = "UTC"),
         created_date_time_EST = lubridate::force_tzs(created_date_time_UTC, tzones = "UTC", tzone_out = "America/New_York")
         )

comments <- comments %>% 
  mutate(created_utc_converted = lubridate::as_datetime(created_utc),
         created_date_time_UTC = lubridate::force_tz(created_utc_converted, tzone = "UTC"),
         created_date_time_EST = lubridate::force_tzs(created_date_time_UTC, tzones = "UTC", tzone_out = "America/New_York")
         )
```


Example of joining comments and posts and filtering by css class. 
We will want to narrow down the columns that are returned here. 
```{r}
daily_full <- posts %>% 
  filter(link_flair_css_class == "daily") %>% 
  inner_join(comments, by = c("link_id"))

```
