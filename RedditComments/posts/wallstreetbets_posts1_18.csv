DD.","Once you realize that ALK always beats on earnings, you understand that rallies are hard to predict. The mathematical model from EPS to stock price is downplayed because of the effect of guidance. I don’t fully dismiss the fundamentals however, as statistically we have some metrics that help predict a rally.

I want to divert your attention to the most important fundamental metric: EBITDA/EV. You can use the trend line of this metric, comparing it to stock movement, to find divergences. ALK has such a divergence:



ALK, who has followed EBITDA/EV in the general long-term, has dipped recently. This divergence between EBITDA/EV means it is headed into earnings underpriced for the expected predicted fundamentals. ALK is already selling off prior to earnings, which is a bad sign – sometimes.

Sometimes it is a good sign, because it lowers expectations for earnings, allowing for a bigger rally. More often than not, upward trends prior to earnings surprises are dangerous because of the stock pricing in earnings. The opposite scenario – ALK’s scenario – makes fundamentals more important than usual, as investors will quickly see the lack of convergence between the fundamentals and the stock price.

At least ALK isn’t overpriced – in fact, it has a very low PE. This is what makes ALK especially playable: Low PE stocks have stronger rallies on good earnings and weaker selloffs on bad earnings. Because analysts are clearly underestimating earnings, I think a bullish play on ALK for earnings makes a lot of sense:



(The following is copied from my private earnings newsletter. I entered a position on ALK today at market open with Jul20 $65 calls. This is slightly different from my original recommendation as a result of the down gap caused by UAL guidance on macro factors. Questions welcome.)

It would be surprising to see analyst estimates turn out true, as that’s a significant dip in EPS without a significant catalyst. My EBITDA/EV chart above shows a metric more important than pure EPS and it implies that ALK is doing quite well. By realizing that analysts are in the wrong and that many believe those analysts (I remember many bullish investors bragging about buying more ALK when it was trading at $95, after the Zack’s upgrade to “strong buy”), we can play the other side and gain equally contrarian profits if right.

I give ALK a 69% probability of a rally with a convex payoff curve (reward &gt; risk). Stick with low-cost OTM calls, as this is a speculative play. I like the Feb16 $75 calls, which only cost $50.

Even if ALK rallies, it won’t last long. It typically pulls back quickly, so you should take your profits quickly. If ALK shows a gap on earnings, play the gap accordingly:",,7snv4d,,0,,false,1518578662,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7snv4d/alk_gapping_down_today_earnings_tomorrow_dd/,,,,,

Tencent owns Riot Games, 84% of Supercell and 25 % of Activision Blizzard.","Bullish on electric cars / automated driving?

Bullish on e-Commerce / ePayment solutions / in-app payment? Tencent owns 20% of JD.com and a stake in Vipshop. They, of course, operate WeChat, QQZone and QQ - combined these have MAU of 980 million. Within each of these, they have finance solutions, the biggest being WeChat Pay - part of which is contributing to the 143% Year on Year revenue growth for their other business department (featuring their payment business and Cloud business). 

Did you say you like The Cloud? Don't tell me that you like AI technology, too? 

Tencent owns two AI startup labs. They also run Tencent Cloud - a cloud services provider that has access to the best advertisement machine in China: Tencent's (aforementioned) social media portfolio. 


Now, I know what you're thinking right now:

""Who is this guy, u/snight, with all of these circumstantial and qualitative comments? This isn't fundamental analysis; this is bullshit!"" 
 
Well, to those of you who like to invest on more than just trends, let me posit this: 

Apart from their massive moat, a wealth of investments and insane social media portfolio. (Oh, they also have 43 million subscribers to Tencent video and a growing investment into revenue based literature and music platforms). They also achieved 61% YoY quarterly revenue growth and 45% net profit growth. They have a P/E of only 60, and a forward P/E of 40. They also have USD 13 billion in cash. Ma Huateng - or, as I like to call him, the one true Ma - has silently, steadily and overwhelmingly built up an empire of investments upon layers upon layers of IP with access to one of the biggest user base in the world. 

My last comment is food for thought, and to me, it summarises the entire philosophy of Tencent. You may know that WeChat is a social media platform, I haven't fully fleshed out how you can walk into a store, and (through WeChat) the automated payment technology can [register](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130062/tencent-beats-amazon-launch-unmanned-shop-lags-other-chinese-tech) what you pick up and charge it straight to your phone without you needing to talk to anyone or scan anything. What I haven't yet mentioned is Tencent's apps within apps. Tencent offers an in-app ""app store"", and they now offer [more apps or ""mini-apps"" than Apple's AppStore.](http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2129987/tencent-takes-aim-apple-and-google-app-stores-wechat-mini-program-push).

Many experts believe this will happen in the year 2045, or 27 years from today. Once theese machines are able to create better and smarter versions of themselves, can they truly reach what we consider consciousness? If so, what would their desires be? How long until these superintelligent machines take over our society? Will they recognize humans as their creators and honor and nurture us? Will we be their slaves, their pets, or simply ignored and left to rot on a planet no longer suitable for organic life? How long until these machines proliferate the our entire Galaxy?

At 9AM there may be no volume, but by 12pm there are hundreds traded of that option, meaning it would get screened out early but make it through if run later.

So I think from now on I'll run it a bit later in the day on Monday rather than early market hours (I always run it after the market opens but I'll wait a bit).

The Commerce Department is slated to report new home sales for December at 10:00AM ET (1400GMT) on Thursday. The data is expected to show a decline of 7.9% to 676,000 units for December from 733,000 units in November.

The Labor department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Jan 20. Economist forecast initial jobless claims to rise by 13,000 to 236,000.

Ahead of the duo of reports the dollar, fell sharply against its rivals to 89.02.


**Canada Retail Sales**
Canadian retail sales due Thursday could offer further insight into the health of the Canadian economy following the Bank of Canada’s decision to raise rates last week.

Economists’ forecasts retail sales rose 0.8% in November, well below the 1.5% growth in the previous month. Retail sales excluding automobiles, so-called core retail sales, is forecast to rise 0.9%.

The CAD/USD has tacked on gains against the dollar recently, supported by a rally in oil prices and expectations for further BoC monetary policy tightening.


**ECB Monetary Policy, Draghi Press Conference**
The European Central Bank delivers its decision on monetary policy on Thursday and is widely expected to leave interest rates, marginal lending rate and deposit facility unchanged at 0%, 0.25% and -0.4%, respectively.

The ECB’s monetary policy decision will be accompanying by an appearance from ECB president Mario Draghi in a press conference at 08:30ET.

The rules are that everyone starts with 100k and we have to invest in no less than 10 stocks and not put more than 20% into one stock. The website is markwatch.com and it basically simulates the market in real time. I'd like to think I know more than most of my classmates, but I could still use a lot of help to win.

Most investors have been staying away from NVAX since its crash in late 2016, but 2018 looks like the year where the stock price recovers A LOT.

Once their flu vaccine comes into market (late 2018-early 2019 most likely, they've heavily hinted that FDA will fasttrack it), it will be the #1  efficacious* compared to competition.

      EDIT: If you're thinking of buying, I'd reccomend waiting a few days as the spike right now is definitely exaggerated, wait till it dips back down to about 1.50 - 1.60 but I doubt it'll reach much lower than that

“Assuming a Supreme Court decision or action by Congress permits it, we could see the largest simultaneous expansion of regulated gambling in U.S. history with sports betting in 2018,”

The court is expected by June to decide New Jersey’s case, which seeks to overturn a ban on sports betting by any state that did not meet a 1991 deadline to legalize it. States and private companies in the U.S. and abroad are already moving quickly to position themselves for a favorable ruling.

The report listed 11 states as having a good chance of enacting sports betting bills this year: Massachusetts; Rhode Island; New York; New Jersey; West Virginia; Ohio; Michigan; Illinois; Oklahoma; Kentucky and Indiana.

Over the past few weeks, I, a shoeshiner, have started looking into the world of the stock market and have decided that leveraged ETFs are kickass, but require a reasonable market timing strategy. Thus, the need to discover leading market indicators that weren't total bullshit like the LEI was necessary.

Over the past weekend, I went rooting around for these indicators, and here's what I've found:

Strongest Leading Indicator - Motor Vehicle Retail Sales: Heavy Weight Trucks: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HTRUCKSSAAR

Strong Leading Indicator - New Private Housing Units Authorized by Building Permits
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PERMIT

Somewhat Strong Leading Indicator - Civilian Unemployment Rate (unemployment flatlining or starting to rise)
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE

Okayish Leading Indicator - Hotel Stock Prices Decline (Marriot, Hilton, etc)

My question to all of you is, have you found any more?

This is so fucking serious. That girl in a million years, NEVER would expect her to be hit like that. Never. 

Guess you could short the shit out of the DOW, but when time to collect, there could be no one to collect from. Or should I depend on our computer gods to run forever?  As long as they have the kilowatts.

Things I think about now .... 

Watching a friend go down that fast is something I have never seen before in my life. This was a super fit, working NYC professional, to close to death, at 37. A victim of the Great Epidemic of 2018, that took us all out.

On the other hand, party and bury yourself in the wikipedia entry, it's a mind blowing read.

&gt;The 1918 Influenza Pandemic. The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed more people than the Great War, known today as World War I (WWI), at somewhere between 20 and 40 million people. It has been cited as the most devastating epidemic in recorded world history.

Polaris has a more diverse product line than good ole American Harley and Indian has been stealing market share from Harley(full disclosure, ride motorcycles).  I checked out an Indian Scout at a dealership over the summer and it was sexy as fuck.  If I can snag a few more tendies from SPY calls, I want an Indian as my next bike.

Also, after a long absence from the American Flat Track series (a racing series that Harley has dominated in their absence), Indian absolutely [blew everyone away](http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/american-flat-track-indian-scout-ftr750-becoming-popular-choice-for-privateer-racers/). They teased a street legal [track inspired 1200cc bike](http://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/ftr1200) and I jizzed in my pants when I saw it.  If that thing goes into production it will dominate.

Polaris discontinued its struggling Victory motorcycle line [recently](http://www.startribune.com/polaris-says-it-s-the-end-of-the-line-for-victory-motorcycle-brand/410139155/) and is focusing its motorcycle energies on Indian which shows in a positive fashion.

One problem, however, is that millenials are snowflake pussies who don't have the disposable income or inclination to ride motorcycles so ridership as a whole is an aging and declining demographic despite the fact that riding is fucking awesome.

tl;dr: You should ride a motorcycle and Indian will be a strong positive to the Polaris bottom line for the foreseeable future.",,7txqvp,,0,,false,1518601724,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txqvp/polaris_dd/,,,,,

Edit: The A/D line is pretty much what the name implies.  It attempts to track the running total of shares bought and sold since the beginning.  This line/graph usually tracks very well with the price, which makes sense because the more shares bought results in a higher price-supply &amp; demand of shares.  Sometimes the two diverge, in other words: More shares were bought than sold but the price fell.  This could be for a legitimate reason(earnings miss or news developments) but barring those occurrences, you could bet that the price will correct itself.

All I know is that US Crude oil inventories have fallen from 534 MMBO in April to ~415 MMBO, The API report today showed a 5.1 MMBO draw, Cushing had its biggest drop ever, Crude Imports are down a little, Crude exports are up a little, and it is too cold for domestic production to skyrocket. OPEC. Venezuala. Iran.

Buy some oil futures today, sell tomorrow after the EIA report.  What could possibly go wrong?

Valeura Energy (VLE) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Basically they are a Canadian company doing exploration, development and production of natural gas in Turkey. They're partnered with the Statoil. Recently they conducted four tests on a well called Yamalik-1 of which all four test yielded positive results.

The test was to confirm the presense of a BGCA - Basin Centred Gas Accumulation. Basically an area where natural gas is saturated. The aggregrate test results were a flow of 2.9 million cubic feet (MMcf) of Natural gas per day in addition to 30-70 barrels of condensate per MMcf spanning over depths of 800 meters (2624 feet). A good reading resource that I've used can be found here: http://hydracapital.ca/hydra-blog.html where an individual, Malcolm Shaw, who has a degree in geology was able to explain the results in much more depth than I ever could.

In any case, it appears that a resource assessment should be coming out within the end of the month which I suspect will propel this stock, in Wall Street Bets fashion, to the moon.

How to exceed margin limits and violate Regulation T.,"Ever think to yourself “I can’t believe my Broker doesn’t allow me to borrow more margin backed by potential future gainz.” Well I’ve got the solution for you that is sure to put yourself in a reg T call and get an angry voicemail from your brokers risk department. 

Many of the large brokerage houses allow you to place market sell orders in the pre and post market trading sessions. These orders won’t get filled till the market opens but will free up the entire position and credit your buying power. (Ex. Sell $50,000 in AAPL stock, get ~50,000 BP based on the expectation of that sell order getting filled). Now go ahead and place a buy order, get a fill in the pre market, and cancel that pesky market sell order. Boom - free $50k borrowed out of thin air. 

Next step: (1) sell that stock you bought pre market for massive gains; or (2) sell that stock you bought pre market at a significant loss &amp; wait for your broker to liquidate your account; or (3) ignore all incoming calls &amp; plead ignorance with your broker; or (4) do the same thing tomorrow.

To provide for the repayment of amounts borrowed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the Treasury of the United States, together with interest, over a 30-year period, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. Short title.

This Act may be cited as the “Let the GSEs Pay Us Back Act of 2017”.

SEC. 2. Repayment of Treasury borrowing.

The Secretary of the Treasury and each enterprise (acting through the conservator for the enterprise appointed pursuant to section 1367 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4617)) shall enter into an agreement that modifies the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement for such enterprise to provide as follows:

(1) TERMINATION OF DIVIDENDS.—That after such modification, any Senior Preferred Stock purchased under such Agreement by the Department of the Treasury shall not accrue further dividends.

(2) TREATMENT OF ENTERPRISE DRAWS ON TREASURY.—That any amounts received, before or after such modification, during a single year by the enterprise as a draw on the commitment made by the Department of the Treasury under such an Agreement, shall be treated as a loan made by the Treasury to the enterprise that—

(A) was originated on the date of the last such draw during such year;

(B) has an original principal obligation in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such draws;

(C) has a term to maturity of 30 years;

(D) has an annual interest rate of 5 percent for the entire term of the loan;

(E) has terms that provide for full amortization of the loan over such term to maturity; and

(F) shall be repaid by the enterprise in accordance with the amortization schedule established for the loan pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, subject to paragraph (3).

(3) TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS PAID.—That any dividends paid by the enterprise to the Department of the Treasury under the Senior Preferred Stock Agreement before such modification of such Agreement shall be treated as payments of principal and interest due under the loan referred to in paragraph (2), and shall be credited against payments due under the terms of such loan (in accordance with the amortization schedule established for such loan pursuant to paragraph (2)(E)), first to such loan having the earliest origination date that has not yet been fully repaid until such loan is repaid, and then to the next such loan having the next earliest origination date until such loan is repaid.

SEC. 3. Definitions.

For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) ENTERPRISE.—The term “enterprise” has the meaning given such term in section 1303 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4502).

(2) PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT.—The term “Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement” means, with respect to an enterprise, the Amended and Restated Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements, dated September 26, 2008, amended May 6, 2009, further amended December 24, 2009, and further amended December 24, 2009 (as such agreements may be further amended), between the United States Department of the Treasury and such enterprise.",,7relar,,0,,false,1518555202,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7relar/hr491_let_the_gses_pay_us_back_act_of_2017/,,,,,

I'm new and I want to make money. Here is a thing I don't get:

MU's price is currently at 45$.

If I buy a call e.g.
A) 20JUL2018 40$ for 7$ per contract
or I can buy
B) 20JUL2018 45$ for 5$ per contract

but combined, the first option would cost me 47$ per stock, the other one would cost me 50$ per stock..

so A is better, or am I wrong?

I've included a new tab based off a screener for individual equities using different filters. 

What I look for is really:

Decent P/E

Debt to equity ratio of &lt;=175%

ROE &gt;=10%

ROA &gt;=10% (looking for stocks that don't require debt leverage for ROA)

Positive P/E estimate for 2018

Net profit margin &gt;=5%

Then sort from there.

Here are the column descriptions:

Symbol - duh

Company	- duh

Sector	-duh 

D/E	- Debt to Equity (expressed as % so 175% = 1.75/1)

NPM	- Net Profit Margin

Est. EPS Growth	 - estimated EPS growth from 2017 to 2018 estimate

Rev Growth - revenue growth from prior TTM to this TTM	

P/E - current Price to Earnings

P/E Est 2018 - estimated P/E

P/C - Price to Cash Flow (default sorted)

P/B	- Price to Book

ROE	- Return on Equity

ROA	- Return on  Assets

Distance from PT - Distance from price target per Merrill Lynch (who I like the most). A positive numbers means it is X% **under** the target (so a $9 stock with a $10 PT would be 10%). A negative number means it is X% over the target.

BofA Merrill Lynch rating (low is good)

CFRA rating (high is good)

Morningstar (high is good)

The long and short of it is, Intel is introducing a drastic security measure into their chips through a patch.  It is called KASLR.  This is effective; but at a cost.  A 30-40% performance cost.  Almost all large data/cloud providers (Amazon, Google, etc.) use Intel chips.  

People suspect this is because it's *rumored* a bug exists in the Intel CPUs that allow code to be run across multiple virtual machines on the same host.  A HUGE security vulnerability.  Think, Joe the hacker opening an AWS account and accessing all data on that machine (or even network) completely unrestricted.

I would expect AMD to move upwards heavily on this rumor.

I mean, no sane company would halve the performance of their product without GREAT reason.  And AMD is not doing this.

To begin with, what makes me qualified to make this kind of financial recommendation? Well, why don’t we go over some of my qualifications…

1. I have been a legal adult for almost a full year
2. I received a passing score on the AP Art History Exam
3. I entered AMD a year and a half ago and I am still holding it (shoutout to my boys at r/AMDstock)
4. Less than 75% of my portfolio was given to me by my dad
5. I scored high enough on an online autism test to potentially be a savant
6. I have Investopedia bookmarked in Google Chrome
7. I mock cryptocurrency and tell people who have tripled their money in 18 minutes that they’re in a bubble.
8. And finally, I’m actually working on a script for a stock trading anime, so I’ve done plenty of research on unicorn stocks that will allow my main character (Kiritsigu) to become rich overnight and start snorting coke off the handrails of his yacht.

I’ll admit, I’m pretty proud of everything I’ve listed here, and I think it makes me perfectly qualified for your average joe trying to pick up a hot tip at the water cooler. But we both know that if you’re on this subreddit, you’re no average joe, and you definitely do not work anywhere nice enough to have a water cooler. So of course, this impressive list isn’t nearly enough for you all. Which is why it is time that I introduce the sub-wide baghold of the future, and why I, in particular, am qualified to recommend it: Tencent. 

Those of you who are not familiar with the juggernaut of a company might be asking, “what do they do?” 
They make money. More specifically, they own a bunch of smaller tech companies that make money, and then they take that money. What companies in particular? Go fucking google it, jesus, I can’t do everything for you. But I can tell you one company that they own. Riot Games. As in the Riot Games that develops the most widespread PC game in the world: League of Legends. Now I know what you’re thinking: this kid is just some gold LoL fuckboy who thinks he is a genius for investing in his favorite video game. First off, I’m legally an adult and if you ever call me a kid again I’ll have my dad sue you for slander, secondly, I’m Plat, and finally, I don’t think I’m a genius for investing in my favorite video game, I think I’m a genius for discovering the ultimate investment opportunity.

But wait, there’s more!

Where is Tencent located? If you possessed the motor function and or motivation necessary to google it by now, you would know that it is a CHINESE company! This is huge, because when it comes to China, IM YOUR FUCKING MAN.

It all began when I was a dumb child at the young age of 17, and I decided that I loved anime so much that when I would take Chinese classes so I could understand what my waifu, Rin, was saying in her native language. I did eventually discover that Chinese and Japanese are “totally different languages”, but I already knew how to say hello in Mandarin so I kept going. I’ve worked harder at that class than anything in my life (except this DD of course) and as a result I UNDERSTAND CHINESE. That’s not to say I’m fluent or even know more than about 50 words, but I know enough to be able to give you guys the EXCLUSIVE INSIDER KNOWLEDGE you will need to succeed in the Chinese market. As proof of my Chinese knowledge, allow me to write you all a poem.

我很智残
你们很也智残
所以我们挣钱

Now for the boring part. In the 12 minutes I spent on Yahoo Finance I saw that this incredible corporation has DOUBLED their revenue in just a year! Four quarters in a row they have roundhouse kicked their earnings, and there seems to be no stopping them. I even went so far as to read their last earnings report, and this is where my Chinese understanding really kicks in. Their guidance is super positive, referencing substantial growth in virtually all their sectors. But what’s the one thing you uncultured autists would never think to do? Evaluate the tones. For those of you who don’t know, Chinese is a tonal language, and so the pitch of your voice has to change depending on the word you are saying. I translated the entire earnings report back into Chinese (thank you google translate) and analyzed the tones of every word in it. There is an absolute abundance of second tone words...
“Okay, who gives a shit?” I can see you mumbling as you chew an over cooked chicken tender.

The second tone rises.

It rises high, high up into the sky, like a rocket to the moon. And that is exactly where this stock is going. I believe this so fully that I even sold my Platinum rank League of Legends account, complete with every teemo skin, on eBay for more cash to put in. So join me, and May we together eat delicious tendies dipped in all the Szechuan sauce we can stomach.

Edit: formatting

TLDR: I’m a weaboo who accidentally learned Chinese and is using his knowledge of the tonal system to speculate on a Hong Kong technology holdings company that he know of only because they own his favorite video game. Buy Tencent.

Ford Motor Co on Tuesday estimated financial results for 2017 and 2018 that fell short of investor expectations, in a downbeat forecast that contrasted with a more positive outlook from rival automaker General Motors Co.

Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told analysts at an investor conference in Detroit that higher costs for steel, aluminum, and other metals, as well as currency volatility, could cost the company $1.6 billion in 2018. Cost-cutting actions are underway and will have the biggest impact “in 2020 and later,” Shanks said.

“We are not satisfied by our performance,” he said. “We are excited about our future.”

BlackBerry is a Canadian fall-from-grace hardware/phone manufacturer turned cyber security software company that peaked around 115$ per share back in 2008 and has gained 60% from recent lows to be now sitting at 13.78$.

In 2008 basically figured they were done, they were making Canadian headlines daily as they lost market share, but since 2008 it looks like they've been divesting, relying on some powerful income generating patents, while bringing an end to their hard-ware projects.

A lot of people lost a lot of money on this stocks run down / collapse but it seems like finally they've manage to end the hemorrhaging from running as a failed hardware business and are 'reset' to a small scale lean software business focused on being a leader in security for driverless/self-driving cars.

They've got a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5 where the industry average is 47 and this is likely due to their reputation companies checkered history.

They recently got a bunch of contracts to implement security in cars for automotive companies and seem well positioned to continue and build on that as a foothold.

Besides the amazing run up it has already had, there still might be more juice to squeeze from WWE. A buddy of mine is a huge wrestling nerd and sent me this today:

According to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, there is new speculation that WWE could be moving from NBC Universal to FOX for their next TV deal. Paul Levesque had a preliminary meeting with the heads of FOX Sports. The speculation is that if FOX doesn’t sign UFC, and UFC moves to another network, that they would go after WWE because they would have so much air time to fill on FS 1 and FS 2, which relies heavily on UFC. There is also speculation that FOX may want to buy WWE, so that they won’t have to worry about escalating television rights and losing them in the future. They were interested in doing this with UFC before the price ballooned. With FOX/Disney deal happening, they are cash rich right now.

Word is that McMahon isn’t interested in selling his majority interest just yet, because the feeling that the stock will soar because they will get a big increase in television rights. If the shares hit $40, Vince could continue to do what he’s doing, and sell small pieces of it off while maintaining full voting control. If there’s a UFC level offer ($3.5 billion or more), most feel McMahon would be inclined to sell.


I went long in options after the price dipped due to the insider sell off and XFL rumors a week or two ago. Holding 20 APR 18 34 C

The increase is pretty much across the board, with hardware revenue up 19 percent and software revenue up 18 percent. 

Even though it is undergoing a transition from consoles to digital platforms, the gaming industry has racked up some substantial gains in 2017. Stocks of major gaming companies have shown double- to triple-digit gains this year. Moreover, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry's first fund dedicated to gaming – the ETF Managers Trust Video Game Tech is up by approximately 50% in 2017.

Research firm Goldman Sachs, which recently began coverage of the sector, stated that video game publishers are ""in the middle of a renaissance."" According to a report released by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC), global revenue from video games is expected to hit $93.2 billion by 2019. The firm estimates that global distribution for digital games will reach $12.9 billion during the same time period.

*EDIT

One thing I've noticed is that I'm kind of filtering out some potentially useful results because I'm requiring that there be some volume on the issue **today**. That weeds out some useless ones but it also puts the results at the mercy of other trades.

For instance I just opened a few SPY positions today:

The reason for the intense focus on Omidria revenues is that it matters beyond Omidria's valuation. Omidria revenues collateralize the pipeline (OMS721). If Omidria cannot achieve $65mm in 2018 revenue, they can trigger a default which may allow the lender to take control of the pipeline. Without reimbursement, $65mm is a longshot.
From the latest 10Q: The CRG Loan Agreement requires us to achieve either (a) minimum net revenue amounts through the end of 2021, which are $55.0 million and $65.0 million for the 2017 and 2018 calendar years, respectively, or (b) a minimum market capitalization threshold equal to the product of 6.4 multiplied by the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the CRG Loan Agreement, determined as of the fifth business day following announcement of earnings results for the applicable year. If we are unable to satisfy the minimum annual revenue requirement or the market capitalization threshold for any given year, we may avoid a related default by repaying the shortfall between actual revenues and the minimum revenue requirement for such year using proceeds generated by an equity or subordinated debt issuance. We anticipate achieving the minimum net revenue requirement of $55.0 million for the 2017 calendar year.
The CRG Loan Agreement includes customary events of default (see Note 7 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016). If there is an event of default the lenders may have the right to accelerate all of our repayment obligations under the CRG Loan Agreement and to take control of our pledged assets, which consists of substantially all of our assets including our intellectual property. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate of an additional 4.00% per annum will apply to all outstanding obligations during the existence of an event of default. There was no event of default under the CRG Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2017.",,7s9x40,,0,,false,1518571499,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7s9x40/omeros_loan_obligationsthoughts/,,,,,

Timetable: 3-5 years (if you want quicker gainz, you could always try options).

(1) The Greeks almost have their shit together. 
This summer they'll (hopefully) finalize the last stage of their [nut-busting bailout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-07/greece-s-10-step-road-map-to-a-bailout-program-exit-in-august).  With the [Brexit negotiations](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40788669) taking up most of the limelight this year, the EU might not have the energy/focus to squeeze the Greeks' balls. This could lead to a fairly favorable last stage of the package. Which could lead to tendies for us.

(2) I think that as the Brexit negotiations heat up and as talk increasingly focuses on the nitty-gritty of how the economic shit is actually going to work people will start to get scared and the Euro and Pound will weaken against the dollar. A favorable exchange rate will make Greek goods like [baklava](https://diethood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Coconut-Baklava-1-WP.jpg) more attractive, give their net exports a boost, strengthen their economy, and give us tendies. 

This is not the prevailing opinion. The ECB is [already winding down](https://www.ft.com/content/c276288e-f6d5-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00) their QE and ""hints"" that their tightening will be quicker than [expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/the-euro-is-surging-and-experts-believe-its-only-going-to-stay-that-way.html) which has led to and will probably lead to a stronger Euro.  

That said, I expect the Fed to continue to hike rates regardless of what happens across the pond meaning any disruption in the ECB's tightening program will allow the almighty greenback to make gainz.

(3) Greek unemployment is high but numbers are improving. Sitting at a [20.7%](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-unemployment/greek-unemployment-at-20-7-percent-in-october-idUSEONI140S3) unemployment rate in October, there are a lot of people out of work in Greece.  Why is this good?  Because as their economy strengthens, those people will go back to work and put their recovery into hyperdrive.  What could go wrong?  That unemployment number could stay ridiculously high and less [baklava](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fWBmS9Ta9c0/maxresdefault.jpg) would be produced and we would see a weakening of the baklava/tendie exchange rate.

(4) [Baklava](https://data.thefeedfeed.com/recommended/post_4474762.jpeg) is fucking delicious.

I felt that since I gave the stock $CMI a *Strong Buy* call back in November that I should follow-up with a *Sell* call now that I am closing my position.

This trade went exactly as I hoped it would and I hope I was able to help some of you guys make some money. When I recommended this stock back in November, it was at $158 and the RSI showed that it was extremely oversold. Now that the stock is back up to $181, I feel comfortable closing my position and taking profits before it begins to deteriorate again. The RSI as of today is at about 75 which indicates to me that we’re beginning to reach overbought territory.

I would also like to reiterate my *Fuck Elon Musk* call because he has continued to fail to meet production expectations and he still spends money like it’s going out of style.

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies.

Since WSB has turned into a Micron-only subreddit, I suggest you read up and understand the technology of what you are investing in. 

As you know, Micron makes DRAM or Dynamic Access Random Memory. The other type of high-speed memory used today, is SRAM (static RAM),  random access memory (RAM) that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which stores bits in cells consisting of a vertical capacitor and a transistor, SRAM does not have to be periodically refreshed. However, to retain the bit of information, the SRAM bit-cell needs positive feedback to reinforce the charge / voltage between two nodes. This is the circuit diagram for 1 bit SRAM: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/SRAM_Cell_%286_Transistors%29.svg/400px-SRAM_Cell_%286_Transistors%29.svg.png

Note that it takes 6 transistors to hold 1 bit of information. The DRAM on the other hand only needs 1 transistor and a small capacitor, so effectively the area footprint (per bit) is 6x lower. The first DRAM actually used 10um node and 3 transistor logic per bit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_1103. The DRAM that we use today are 1T: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/306002/why-does-a-dram-cell-necessarily-contain-a-capacitor
The information of a DRAM cell is simply stored as a charge (say a couple electrons in a small femtoFarad capacitor made vertically in the substrate). A ""1"" signal is ""set"" by storing charge from a pass-gate (transistor) and reading is ""read"" by opening this pass-gate again onto another bitline-capacitor (shared by all the DRAM bit cells in a single row or column). This charge in the bitline is digitized and deemed either a ""1"" if the charge (read as a voltage) crosses a certain threshold or ""0"" else. As retention of charge is a huge issue and coupling between neighboring DRAM cells is a growing concern, scaling of DRAM has become a major problem unlike SRAM which is designed with conventional digital CMOS. Lots of fabrication techniques and IP have and are continuing to address DRAM-specific optimizations and as such this means that DRAM development has diverged from the conventional digital design process, which means that only Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix and Nanya have fabs that are designed and optimized for DRAM development whereas TSMC, Intel cannot. 

Why use DRAM over SRAM? While we can see SRAM in registers to L2 cache in SMs in GPUs and register files to L2 cache in CPUs, the area (in um^2) can quickly blow up by increasing the number of bits. And silicon real estate is expensive. Well why do we use SRAM anyway? Because SRAM is on-chip next to the computing logic, it is also a lot faster and more energy-efficient than a DRAM read/write access off-chip. To give you some idea, the majority of the CPU area footprint is the SRAMs scattered all over the die. But the total cache size is ~MByte range. Compare this with a 1GB DRAM that can store 5000 256x256 images @8-bit precision (1GB / (256^2 * 8 bits * 3 RGB)), while stashing the image onto your cpu's cache can maybe hold a couple. With high-throughput and parallel workloads such as deep learning, optimization, gaming, video encoding, crypto-mining (hashing), etc, we are starting to see that hardware is quickly becoming memory and IO bound rather than compute-bound. For example, deep learning kernels are almost always designed to be IO bound. Please read the TPU paper: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilhMie67rYAhVTImMKHTHHAXcQFggpMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1704.04760&amp;usg=AOvVaw00srXJTsZI5Jf3Z14zY3QJ

TLDR:
EDIT:
What I am trying to say is that in our world of big data and IoT and AI and blockchain, high-speed + high-throughput memory is key. For that reason, DRAM is a quintessential ingredient in next-generation computing systems and fabrics and will continue to play a pivotal role from data-centers to automotive to drones to GPUs, Alexa devices, smartphones, FPGAs (with Micron's HMCs), etc. It will be EVERYWHERE. We do not live in a compute-bound world anymore; we live in a communication/memory-bound one. 

EDIT2:
To clear up some confusion, high-throughput computing requires both DRAM (high throughput, high memory size in bits) and SRAM (low memory size in bits but high-speed (right next to compute)). They are both needed and play important heterogeneous roles in the memory hierarchy: see the architecture of a GPU, TPU, FPGA, CPU-w/ system memory.",,7nrwi7,,0,,false,1518488241,false,self,t5_2th52,false,technicals,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7nrwi7/why_dynamic_access_random_memory_and_why_micron/,,Call me a faggot until I eat a shoe,,Technicals,

Why a strong buy:

1. Record Switch sales.  Switch is the fastest-selling console in the US and Japan.  I do not have news regarding elsewhere, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Switch is dominating Europe, Australia, and the rest of Asia as well.

2. Nintendo is about to implement a fee for online use - which most Switch users will pay.

3. Nintendo stock dropped ~15% following the less than spectacular release of Animal Crossing mobile.  I believe this is an overreaction.

4. Amazon's best seller list has the Switch, Switch games, and Switch products occupying many of the highest sold products in the video games category.

5. Nintendo has earnings at the end of the month.  It is also currently deflated a bit due to the Animal Crossing situation.  I believe, regardless of how it performs in earnings, that it will have a very large run-up to at least the level it was one month prior (~$57, now it is at $47).  Furthermore, I also believe Nintendo will at least meet, and likely beat analysts EPS.  More on this below.


On the downside:

1. Analysts forecast an EPS of 0.44.  This is very high compared to prior EPS', and I have not created a model, nor seen the models of the analysts that they use to justify this amount.  From a gut-feeling I believe that Nintendo will at least meet this, and in its earnings report forecast huge growth potential.

""I'm in ATE with &gt;250k shares. My ultimate YOLO. John Wallace(their scientific chief) is a literal genius. He has devoted his whole life perfecting ulcer reduction medications and come January he will sing his swan song and prove to the world with the phase 2 trial of their lead drug ATB346 that it works. After that, partner up or sell the rights of ATB346 to big pharma for $150M+ then do the same with the second 2 drugs in the pipeline. My 14 cent shares become easily $2.75c shares within the next 2 years. They had a fault in their first phase 1 trial when someone with hepatitis and gallstones lied to get into the trial for money. Had increased liver enzymes and they found out afterwards. They also realized just how potent their new anti inflammatory is. They were approved to continue with trials and in their phase 2a trial discovered they can use 1/6 the dose of their version of naproxen and get DOUBLE the WOMAC pain reduction. WOMAC is a pain reduction scale. Higher the number the higher the reduction in pain. All antibe wanted to do with that double blind trial was price their drug relieved pain as well as aleve and it actually had double the pain reduction. They're doing a phase 2B trial right now results due Q1 2018 to prove their drug causes no ulceration in the stomach which is a massive problem with naproxen and all other non selective cox inhibitors. When they prove they've created an NSAID based off naproxen with double the pain relief, 1/6 The dosage, less blood pressure effects and NO GI effects it will be a world changing drug. The last piece of the puzzle comes together in Q1 I'm so fucking excited lol. Stock has traded sideways for 8 months now after their last PP and investors are finally coming back to it to get in before trial results come out (still on track for Q1 2018).

Here is a video of him talking to a bunch of doctors presenting their science behind the drug and their journey in the trials thus far. It's not presented pumping it to a bunch of hedgies for money which is why it's such a great video to watch.

The stock was up and I bought about $500 of puts. I'm new to options so I didn't want to risk much and I sold pretty early on Wednesday morning for 130% gain. Could have made a lot more if I had waited a few hours, but that's not the point. This was one of my first options plays and I was very happy with myself and it got me wondering how often do such easy opportunities come along and how do you find them?

It was obvious to me that the Intel news was a big deal and the markets hadn't reacted yet. An up to 30% performance drop in all the huge data centers was going to cause a big red day for Intel. I was confident about my trade, but being an amateur I was not confident enough to risk a lot of money. Now, though, I have a thirst for more. Unfortunately I bought more INTC puts yesterday because of this, and I think I let my moneylust blind me because they are not looking good. I might get lucky next week, but I'm afraid INTC may have bottomed out for now. 

I don't really know where INTC is going from here, so I'm probably done playing with them for now. I want to know where to start looking for my next play though. I'm afraid this opportunity was so rare that I'm going to have blueballs looking for another. Should I just go to the casino?

I have a question about the option expire date:

example: I own this call:

AAPL, 20180202, 170, CALL, Option, SMART, USD

Is it possible to sell it on the second of february (expire date)? More specific: sell it during the trading hours?
Or is Thuersday the last day to sell the call?

I think I can sometimes identify weak FUD like that. However mapping it to a small dip, may be more difficult.

If you want a longer, in-depth article on a single stock, let me know. It’s best we reserve in-depth analyses for earnings plays that are further out, so that we can capture the pre-earnings drift.

Stock: General Electric (GE)
Direction: Short
Probability: 84%
Payoff curve*: Convex
Options strategy: Long put
1.	Buy Jun15 $12 put

Analysis: To start, GE has a very ugly pullback characteristic:

 

The 30 day and 60 day trends are those of a stock with strong bearish tendencies – a bearish momentum play. I’m afraid we’ve already missed much of this momentum play, but for earnings these statistics show GE is likely to act bearishly after earnings: either by retracing its rally or by forming a breakaway gap. Two traders looking at GE’s chart could surmise different trends: a strong bearish momentum play and an oversold status.

It is the latter that concerns us, as oversold stocks shouldn’t be trusted as short earnings plays due to their tendency to use earnings to bounce back – think of this as “buying the rumor and selling the news” or as profit taking – or simply as the stock incorporating its earnings prior to the report. You can see that GE is not likely to have a reversal coming, as its stochastics are not just oversold but oversold buried. GE’s stochastics, in other words, should be taken as evidence as downward momentum instead of overreaction, making a short play safe in this case, fortunately.

Where GE will finally find support is questionable. I don’t see any stop in sight because GE is still expensive relative to the industry (PE comparisons), and that makes GE a candidate for a short turtle trade, a breakaway trading strategy. You could take earnings as an entry point to such a trade, which makes sense here based on GE’s post-earnings movements (selloffs lead to further downward motion). I’ve tracked GE as a short play many times in the past but have yet to trade it because of overemphasizing the fundamentals, yet over the past year I’ve come to realize that the fundamentals are of little importance with GE earnings.

The statistics here are good enough for a short play, and the only thing standing in our way is the perception that GE has already sold off “enough” (hint: it hasn’t).

Stock: Ford (F)
Direction: Short
Probability: 69%
Payoff curve*: Linear or slightly concave
Options strategy: Short bear ratio spread
1.	Sell 1x Mar16 $13 put
2.	Buy 3x Mar16 $12 put

Analysis: Insiders are selling their Ford stock. The buy:sell ratio currently sits at 5:1, which either implies that target prices have been reached or bad news is incoming. I noticed that Ford has had such high amounts of insider selling for quite some time now, which throws the target price theory out the window; I think insiders know that Ford’s status is on the decline.

The auto industry is not my forte, but we can all look to experts to indirectly gain insight on where the market is headed. At this time, I wonder why Warren Buffett, an expert in investing in stable growth, has no money in Ford – or other carmakers – with the exception of Tesla. I think the fundamentals of Ford and the economic headwinds for the auto industry (see my other articles) are both important downsides that will become increasingly discussed in earnings calls.

We should be especially careful with the dividend. I see bad things for the dividend if the fundamentals don’t improve, yet on the flip-side, the 5% yield creates a lower bound, which creates an upper bound for our profit. We avoid this danger via a creative options play that enhances the probability of profit. 

The above options strategy allows for a profit even if we are wrong and Ford investors come back for the yield and surprise good news, but it also allows us to profit if Ford continues its decline. 

Stock: Comcast (CMCSA)
Direction: Long
Probability: 79%
Payoff curve*: Linear or slightly concave
Options strategy: Ratio calendar call spread
1.	Sell 1x Jan26 $42.50 call
2.	Buy 2x Feb16 $42.50 call

Analysis: Comcast is trading at a 20-day high that makes it a candidate for a turtle trade (breakout trade). Let’s look at earnings as a catalyst for that breakout; if we do, any rally could be considered the buy signal for such a trade, size be damned. How Comcast breaks that 20-day high, in other words, is less important than that it does.

Insiders seem serious about their hopes for Comcast, as the insider buy:sell ratio has risen. Before we consider insiders, however, we should look at the daily pattern of CMCSA to get a grip on how regular investors are thinking. While my Markov chain model shows strong bullishness on the part of the average trader/investor, it also shows fear; for example, if CMCSA opens lower than the previous day’s high, it sells off during the day with 80% probability – a sign of profit-taking but not necessarily bearish (dip buyers have more power and bring CMCSA back up the following day, in 91% of cases).

In the middle of this earnings analysis, I seemed to have discovered a day-trading pattern, which I will likely be trying out in and after earnings. CMCSA’s day-trading pattern is pretty simple: short when it opens low and buy at the end of a black candlestick day; expect 20% ROI per day for 100 delta options.

I will be streaming my CMCSA day-trading strategy on Twitch.tv/SeekingVega.

CMCSA is showing signs of a coming breakout, and my numbers show that earnings should be good; put together, we have a high probability of entering a breakout trade at the ground floor. 

*Linear: Equal risk/reward.
*Convex: Reward &gt; risk

&gt;The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL -0.07% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life.",,7ozbui,,0,,false,1518510018,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7ozbui/tech_is_going_to_be_the_big_tobacco_of_our_time/,,made a poetry thread,,,

So one of my takeaways for this year was to try and be long on QQQ.

Ok, so I've made a nice profit so far by doing this, especially over the course of the last week where QQQ has been on a rocket ship... but I am CERTAIN there a major market correction is imminent.  

So now I'm in the dilemma of whether to just eat the dip, or swing trade and accept the higher tax burden.

Need some advice, wsb

All i hear is  people thinking interest rates and inflation will continue to stay very low for a long time. Oil and gold continues to moon, granted gold a little slower but rising nonetheless, and for what? its a stock market party.  But  if oil goes to the $80-100 range and it seems like that's not a dream anymore then it will have detrimental effects  to the consumer and economy. 

The dollar is plunging, bonds are plunging, yields are rising, commodities are rising. Who will buy our debt if the dollar and bonds continue to fall?  why would they when it appears commodities and other currencies are better investments. There is something happening in the market that the bulls refuse to acknowledge. Maybe Qe 4? is what every investor and trader is hoping for? Then goodbye dollar.

Inflation is coming, and stagflation will be next if the proper steps are not taken.

The same situation played out during 1987 and interest rates were extremely higher and look how that turned out. The dollar fell just as fast in such a short amount of time in the beginning of the year. The stock market had record high valuations, record amounts of debt only to crash hard as what was called black Monday.

Tell me i am wrong and why this won't happen. Literally wanting some rational discussion about the stock market and the U.S. dollar's health.


If the dollar breaks 85, i don't see any support...and if oil,gold, etc rocket higher then the party might be over faster than you all expected

edit: i am also having a hard time  pondering about the potential future infrastructure bill- that the stock market wants. How helpful would another trillion dollars of debt be with the falling dollar

Are you ready? I tried to make it as simple as possible, but it will help if you have a basic understanding of advanced cosmology/geology as well as at least a fifth grade understanding of thermal encabulation chambers. And without further adieu, here it is:

For all since recorded history, the ancients have praised the sun in many different ways. For example, the aztecs made sacrifices to the sun gods. The aztecs were smart people. They had a lot of gold. So clearly they were on to something. Also, the Egyptians had a god named Ra who was super powerful and was the god of the sun. The Egyptians were also pretty smart and there's an 80% chance they were friends with aliens, and the aliens probably told them to worship the sun in exchange for building the pyramids.

See a pattern? It all goes back to the sun. The sun, being the biggest planet, attracts all of the other planets because opposite charges attract (if this doesn't make sense to some of you fags, then please start paying attention in science class instead of staring at your phone at semiconductor stocks). The sun also does another crazy thing. It makes light. Light is the opposite of darkness which happens at night. Light happens during the day, which is when people go to work. And that is when people get paid. 

Read those last two sentences again. Because we have light, people work, and get paid, and get money. This is where my solid investment advice comes in: in order to get money, we have to invest in the SUN! That's where the money comes from! But how do we invest in the sun??

The sun goes by the nickname sol, which is pronounced šœl. Don't worry if you don't understand this, I met linguistics professor once and absorbed some of his knowledge in order to understand this. Also, not many people know this much about the sun, but I know it because I studied the Wikipedia article on the sun as part of my research for making this post. Other research included staring at the sun for 3 minutes (don't worry I wore my glasses).

I digress. What's important is that the sun is named sol. After some linguistic analysis, I realized that it is important to find words that start with sol. And what starts with sol? Solar!!! Which is actually a crazy coincidence, because the sun and solar energy are totally unrelated things. But the sun is the source of all money, and my linguistic analysis points towards ""solar"", so logically we must invest in the technology that was named after the sun. 

I will try to explain why you should invest in solar from a more technological standpoints. Solar panels use thermal encabulation chambers to ionize ambivertatious girdle fluid, which then corrodes the oscillating flanger to produce a mitosis effect which produces electricity (because opposites attract). While it is a fairly simple process, a lot of people don't realize the value here. For example, if the ancient Aztecs were alive and were able to see solar panels, they would invest all of their gold and maybe even some of their sheep. So why wouldn't you?

Also, let's do a little bit of politics. I don't know what you guys all think about our boy trump up in the whitehouse, but he's got a decision to make by January 26th. He's gotta say YES or NO to tariffs from solar panels. And if he says YES, solar might be screwed in America for a while. But if he says NO (and I know he will) then we will all be able to enjoy our tendies and go past the moon all the way to the sun. Why do I think he'll say no to tariffs? Because he's a cultured man with a wise mind, and anyone who's cultured would know how much the aztecs worshipped the sun, and trump will do the favor of honoring their wishes (while also maybe pocketing some of their gold).

So, that about wraps it up. We got a historical reason, a linguistic reason, a technological reason, and a political reason for why solar is the best place to put your money. The best stock to pick in this industry is the one named after the sun. Buy SUNPOWER and ride with me to the sun!

tl;dr aztecs worship the sun, aliens told Egyptians to worship the sun, the sun makes money, the sun is called sol, invest in solar, trump is a wise man, opposites attract, so buy SUNPOWER",,7oh0tu,,0,,false,1518500871,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7oh0tu/use_the_sun_for_profit/,,"SPY: -0.37% ""Bubble's popping!""",,,

2018 seems like a good year for construction mats and aggregates.

Now that tax reform has passed, it appears the Trump presidency is ramping up support for infrastructure. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/05/camp-david-trump-push-republicans-make-infrastructure-top-2018-priority/1003283001/

And Rand “ramen noodles” Paul wants to use cuts in foreign aid to pay for infrastructure which would get the libertarians vote on board. https://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/homenews/senate/367499-rand-paul-introducing-bill-to-eliminate-aid-to-pakistan%3famp

Fisher Industries (private) has won the contract for the wall prototype. https://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/835511. While this creates no value in Fisher (at this point), it does leave plenty of meat on the bone for supplementary companies to cash in. 

Many will say that the move (in mats/construct) happened when Trump was elected and the value has been added in. I disagree. Trump lives to build. He has always been building grandeur and impressive structures. I believe it is greatly important to Trump to have built something in this nation that he can stamp his name all over; names on bridges (airports,infrastructure,etc) live for a long time. Lots of new money will be floating around - ultimately healthy for the market, giving a great opportunity for many companies to cash in. 

In my opinion, these would be some stocks to monitor.

Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 8th from 10:30 - 11:30 AM. Celgene has solid fundamentals and has been trading around the $100-$105 level since approximately mid October; which is down from the $130-$140 range it was trading at during that time. During this conference, they will be pre releasing earnings and guidance, which if even remotely positive, I believe will boost the stock in a positive fashion. In addition, Celgene is coming into support and has held its current levels very well. Subsequently, I took on a very small position ($1k) and am holding some of next week's 108 calls and some of the regular January expiry 107 calls. Logic may seem confusing, but shake and bake baby. Let me know what you jabronis think and if you are going to hop on the Celgene train for some quick and easy tendies.

TL;DR - Celgene may go up, down, or sideways on Monday. If you want to risk some money on an earnings play, this would not be your worst idea.

Here's some guidance and peace of mind for the future though:

Major sectors for SP500: There are 8 of them 

* Technology
* Basic Materials
* Services
* Health Care
* Financial 
* Consumer Goods
* Industrial Goods
* Utilities 

Looking back in just the last year - If you went with the 3 largest companies from each sector (ignoring the micro sectors within each) that is approx 24 to 28  different stocks.

* Technology: GOOGL, MSFT, FB
* Basic Materials: XOM, CVX, SLB
* Services: AMZN, WMT, DIS/CMCSA,COST
* Health Care: JNJ, PFE,MRK
* Financial : JPM, WFC, BRK, BAC/C/V
* Consumer Goods: AAPL, KO/PEP/PG
* Industrial Goods: GE,MMM,HON/BA
* Utilities : NEE,DUK,D

Whatever your combination of these (all some, but at least 2/3).

Outcome: In a bull market, no major correction

1) You'd have a 80 to 92% win rate in selection. Your portfolio would be positive 73% of the time (44/60 months) .

2) On a 10K investment your total portfolio would be 24,000 (140% return)

3) Your max loss would be &lt;10%. However, as long as you can maintain this portfolio for a minimum of 2 years you'd still be positive.

4) Your average annual adjusted return is around 19%.

5) You'd beat the spy by about 15% or $3000.

Note: This does not include any major drawdowns that would come from a correction/black swan event. 

So how do you deal with a black swan event/or flash crash major correction?

1) You can retain 50% of your cash earning a GIC rate of 2% short term. This would give you a total return of around 70% not including dividends paid.  This will give you flexibility to average down and double your allocations.

2) You can maintain a trailing stop. Once you get stopped out, it is suggested you try to get back in as soon as possible. Your best bet to weather a crash is using a 10% draw down and a timeframe before you start re-allocating- give yourself either 6 months to one year before putting your money back in.

The downside of this, is you'd have commission costs- However you'd still earn more by doing this over the SPY.

$0(RobinHood) 

$176(IB)

$240 (Questrade)

$559(TD/any major) 

Best of luck!

Why? 

First off this nigga Jeff Sessions about to fuck up all the tendies you've made so far. 

ETF's like MJX need a custodian to actually hold the securities they trade. MJX's custodian is US Bank. Here's the thing though, no bank wants to hold securities related to weed especially with Sassy Sessions around.  US Bank could risk losing its FDIC insurance for fucking around with WEED. 

BUT HERES THE BIGGER SHIT: US BANK DIDN'T ORGINALLY AGREE TO BE THE CUSTODIAN FOR A WEED ETF. 

MJX only began trading in its current form in like December. They changed their name (so that they would not have to refile for SEC clearance) so that they could trade marijuana securities. US bank didn't approve this change and they could possibly pull the plug on MJX at anytime meaning that either they scramble for a new custodian (which no bank would want to do for a devil lettuce etf) or they stop trading entirely and your shares are worthless. 



Stop fucking around and sell. 



P.S since this is wsb I know you autistic cucks will probably want to keep smoking the devils kush but remember that everytime you smoke the kush you light up the flames like george bush. 

Wait till it's in  sub 33 territory to buy again if you want to gamble. I'm not gonna touch this shit until Sassy Sessions is fired.

So my money is now on $KEM.

Capacitors are the future, and Kemet is one of the market leaders. They're shares dropped 40% last earnings because of 2 reasons, they had an EPS of .45 (beating expectations) but algorithms misread it as .22 and sold shares. This is because of court fees that all capacitor manufacturers had to pay. 

The second reason is they said they were entering a quiet period and that scared some people away. That quiet period ends at next quarterly report which is February 1st. A few weeks away. There was a presentation to large position shareholders at a recent BOA Merrell Lynch convention and shares didn't drop, meaning large holders were content with the state of the company. Shares are trading around 16 and I expect them to make a strong move toward the 52 week high of 27 after they release their quarterly report. They've gotten new products on the market and have a strong outlook since the drop. The CEO even made a statement after the drop that there was no basis for it and their fundamentals are stronger than ever since the TOKEN acquisition.
In short, for all you dyslexic retards, buy $KEM and sell somewhere in the mid-high 20's. I expect it to be there by March, but the market may take longer to react.

Doctors were giving bad doses, people were starting the meds sick as fuck already, and with better education between the company and the doctors, they'd have been fine. I imagine they've learned this. Basically, though, the drug wasn't what killed people. Nonetheless, investors freaked out and in September it dropped 50%.

NASH is a currently untreatable liver disease that is common and growing across the globe, affecting 2%- 5% of the USA.

1) Expect a higher than expected guidance for upcoming earnings for Apple and Micron as USDCNY is projected to continue to sink into early 2018 as result of tax cuts and low interest rates with unusually low inflation rates due to the Amazon-effect. 

2)  Expect higher margins in Europe as a result of ECB's fiscal tightening.

3) DRAM prices: The Korean Won strengthened against the USD by 7% this year, slashing memory margins of the top 2 DRAM suppliers: Samsung and SK Hynix. This puts pressure for Samsung and SKH to keep DRAM (and NAND) prices high, which is a good sign for Micron.

4) Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterates a strong buy and PT to 55.

5) Manish Nigam of Credit Suisse says he expects that current ""exceptionally high"" D-RAM chip margins around 60% are sustainable:

Here's how the company's results fared against analyst expectations:

EPS: $6.24 vs. $6.02 expected by Thomson Reuters
Revenue: $3.469 billion vs. $3.321 billion expected
Total assets under management: $6.288 trillion vs. $6.248 trillion expected by StreetAccount
Net inflows: $103 billion vs. $93.5 billion expected
The company also reported full-year results, noting its assets under management rose 22 percent in 2017. Its net inflows, meanwhile, totaled a record $367 billion.

""Full year net inflows represented 7% organic asset growth and were positive across client types, asset classes, major regions and investment styles,"" CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. ""Investors are increasingly seeking comprehensive solutions, and BlackRock's differentiated ability to offer scaled investment strategies, industry-leading risk management and portfolio construction technology and thought leadership is driving deeper client partnerships than ever before.""

BlackRock's exchange-traded fund business saw $54.8 billion in net inflows during the fourth quarter, pushing iShares assets under management up to $1.752 trillion.

The asset manager also increased its quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $2.88 per share.

BlackRock shares are off to a solid start for 2018. They are up 3.5 percent for the year thus far.

The stock also had a strong performance last year. In 2017, BlackRock rose 35 percent.

But J.P. Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington thinks the stock further upside. Last month, Worthington said he sees the company benefitting from "" higher fee rates and margins, driven by better non-US equity market returns."" He also called BlackRock his top financials pick heading into 2018.

BlackRock noted it expects the recent tax overhaul to give the company's bottom line a 17 percent boost on an adjusted basis.

GDP growth for 2018 is expected to grow, likely around 3%.
Signs of a late stage cycle, however if Trump focuses on infrastructure like he is planning it should add legs to the bull run.
Confidence in the economy hit 66% this week, the highest ever recorded.
Global GDP growth is set to continue throughout 2018.
most major investment firms believe the markets will grow throughout 2018 (Goldman, Merril, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley).
Consumer confidence hit all time high since 2000.
Consumer spending is likely to continue once financial relief from tax cut is realized.
2017 was the most expensive Christmas in US history.
Leading Economic Index (LEI) is not showing any signs of an incoming recession.

The bull market appears to be continuing steady through 2018, while markets appear over-valued we aren't quite yet in the melt-up stage. Investors have their sights set on infrastructure which will give an enormous boost to GDP leading into 2019. The markets are being driven by positive sentiment and speculation, and backed by economic growth/relief and fundamentals. I think if all goes as planned 2018 could be another year of dank gainz

There’s also Cramers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Stocks for Dummies. The Micron investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these fundamentals, to realize that they’re not just meme stocks- they say something deep about LIFE and the viability of the market as a whole. As a consequence people who dislike $MU are truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jim Cramer's existential catchphrase ""Bulls make money. Bears make money. Hogs get slaughtered.” which itself is a cryptic reference to Goldman Sachs quarterly reports. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Donald Trumps genius wit unfolds itself on their portfolios. What fools.. how I pity them. ��

And yes, by the way, I do masterbate to  a picture of Lisa Su. And no, you cannot see me do it. It’s for the Su Bae's eyes only- and even then she has to demonstrate that she has over 80% of her portfolio holding Micron.

When they filed their S1 for their IPO they mentioned they planned on issuing approximately 20 million shares in the unknown future as stock compensation to reward those employees who started off early and that when those shares are awarded that it would affect earnings negatively. They also issued an extra 9 million shares at slightly above the current trading price. 

My question is does the s8 filing put those shares immediately in play? Does that mean BSTI will take a one time stock loss of $8 (9 dollars minus .69 approximately) x 20,000,000 shares? Meaning they will take a one time Q4 loss of $160,000,000? 

Does wall street usually overlook these one time expenses given that it was mentioned in the IPO or will it take everyone by surprise with an extra loss of 160mm for Q4? 

I interpret it in two different ways. 1. The company has decided that their stock price is at the bottom and decided to take the loss now to minimize losses in the future. 2. The company is a bunch of crooks who could have exercised the shares over time but decided to dilute everything in one shot.

Can anyone shed light on these S8 filings? This s8 filing seems awfully large for the company of this size (4 billion market cap). There are currently 227 million shares outstanding. Did this s8 dilute the company by 10% immediately at the detriment of shareholders? 

Thanks!

It’s the boom that should make you feel Leary

Mal-investments wreck the economy

The boom starts off
With an expansion of credit
The fed sets rates low,
Are you starting to get it?

That new money is confused 
For real lonable funds
But it’s just inflation 
That’s driving the ones
Who invest in new projects 
Like housing construction
The boom plants the seeds
For its future destruction

The savings aren’t real,
Consumptions up too
And they’re grasping for resources
Which reveals are too few

And the boom turns to bust
As interest rates rise
For the cost of production
Price signals relies

The boom was a binge,
That’s a matter of fact
Now it’s devalued Capital
That makes up the slack

Well there is the late 20’s
Or 2005
Where booming bad investments
Seems like they’d thrive
You must cease to invest
Don’t use the printing press
Or a bust will surely follow
An economy depressed

Being a part of this sub for a while I know the humour towards TSLA seems never-ending, however my aim here is to create a serious discussion about the company and its future (with an appropriate measure of humour). 

To start with my own DD, I'm short selling Tesla as of last week and my reasons behind it are as follows: 

1.) The company has consistently undershot earnings estimates for years now, and although revenues are rising they're not nearly rising fast enough to close the gap (gross profit has infact fallen quarter after quarter for the whole of this year thus far). Tesla also as of recently achieved a ROIC % of -18.32. Thus as a company it is actually unable to make any money with the money you invest into it, it's simply losing it and then turning to the next nearest investor. 

2.) Interest expense represented a whopping 200,000$ in 2016. To put that in comparison, Alibaba paid 388,000$ in interest for the 2016, yet is actually profitable and has a market cap of almost 10 times the size of Tesla. Moreover, to make things worse Tesla have now announced they will accumulate even more debt through issuing another round of bonds (https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tests-money-managers-demand-180753134.html). I almost also forgot to mention that US interest rates are being aggressively hiked this year (or at least forecasted to) thus for the long term debt Tesla holds (which is a huge proportion) it will see even bigger interest repayment bills. Finally, the more debt Tesla amasses the higher the premium it will have to pay to borrow (if it can find anyone left that will actually be willing to lend to them). 

3.) A more recent concern of mine which largely lead me to actually act on my bearish instinct with Tesla is the new pay package for Musk. In my eyes it's an 'All or nothing' experiment where he can gamble away government injected money in a hope to win big. If things begin to go south and market cap growth isn't reaching its target you can expect irrational short term behaviour to prop up the stock price at the expense of future returns. I.e. Its very likely long term debt will be accumulated to prop up the market cap at the expense of huge debt bills in the future and a rapidly deteriorating credit rating. 

4.) Teslas are a fairly niche market. They're not cheap and although they have a strong (some would say) cult following, they are soon going to be facing real competition from the likes of Daimler (parent of Mercedes) who have innovated aggressively since inception. Furthermore - with improving economic prospects for the Eurozone and the likes of German car manufacturers positioned well for the transition to electric cars, Tesla will be fighting a war on many fronts. More importantly this war will be fought against the same companies that have strong and deep customer loyalty rooted in the whole of Europe and well established trade routes with countries such as the UK and France. Their ability to trade freely across borders within the EU makes German Auto firms much more appealing to countries like Sweden and Norway where an electric car culture is becoming rapidly apparent. 

5.) Finally, Musk has missed every production target set thus far, by an extreme measure and to make matters worse key employees are packing up and moving elsewhere. Supply chain problems are also an issue and the actual ability to safely recycle lithium batteries remains at the forefront of environmental discussion. To make matters worse Trump is going to have to actually find a way to fund these policies he's pushing through to make 'everyone better off' and 'america great again'. In order to do exactly this he may begin by cutting the very thing he doesn't believe in... Climate Change. Tesla receives hordes of support from the government at present however with Trump not even sold on the idea, who's to say he doesn't turn around tomorrow and stop dishing out credits to firms battling this 'fantasy' as he puts it.

There are many other points to cover which I will in due discussion however these are a few of the key reasons why I believe Tesla is a solid short play. Although this is my opinion it is not financial advise and I wish to hear other peoples' opinions on both my own opinions and the future of Tesla. I have an abundance of respect for Musk. He is a fantastic man and is a complete visionary, however Rule 1 of trading is to ignore the heart and listen to the brain however hard they may repel in beliefs. 

p.s - Although Tesla may have been a good risk play in another scenario, I forgot to mention that it commands a forward P.E ratio of approx -80.5. This extreme premium for a company with such a long trail of risk. One last point before I force myself to stop - selling flamethrowers seems like an interesting way to raise capital but imo a stupid way, especially when you're the face of a multibillion dollar company. If a house burns down/someone is killed by one of these things Musk is gunna have a hell of a lot to answer for.",,7u66me,,0,,false,1518605879,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7u66me/tsla_real_talk/,,,,,

0) Trump made a brilliant speech of American economic dominance and prosperity. He also touted a infrastructure and defense spending. 

1) Samsung reported MASSIVE earnings for semis particularly in memory. Also showed huge beats to OLED but slightly moderated guidance however this is in the realms of the effect of seasonality (every year).

1) Eurozone reported a huge GDP beat yesterday (https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/30/eurozone-gdp-france-growth-recovery-market-business-live)

New GDP figures from Eurostat confirm that the European recovery remains on track, with annual growth of 2.5% during 2017 in the EU and the narrower single currency block. That’s the strongest annual growth in a decade.

1b) Japan reported encouraging employment numbers (http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2018/01/29/Japans-robust-labor-demand-bolsters-outlook-wage-increases)

2) Massive earnings week

3) Yellen likely to remain dovish due to recent lukewarm GDP growth for Dec, low inflation and wage numbers but cautious.

4) Asian markets (still) reacting negatively to Apple rumors (lagging)

5) 10Y Yields  stablizing

6) we have seen many beats in equities thus far ~80% revising forecasts higher

Buy April 150 puts for cheap, triple your money.

Why?

Simple... all their toying with censorship is pissing people off. Zuck is in the middle and can't win. Either he censors or he gets blamed for allowing crap.  Since he doesn't want blame, it's censorship.  Well -- the first time one of your posts gets flagged because it was a gif, fine.  After the fourth time, most people say fuck it, I'm not going on facebook if they are going to tell me what I can say and not say.

Simple.

So the Q1 results are going to be crappy as they are forced to scale down profitable ads from one camp and get less eyeballs and growth metrics on the other.

Look at the chart, tho!  Who would short into that strength?  Well, just how long in the tooth is this rally again?  Doubtlessly, you can wait to buy the puts after the top is put in, but those who want more than a triple could do what I do and make what I make alongside the winner of the 2016 call of the year on WallStreetBets.

This is gonna be fun watching the stock top out going into profit taking weakness in March/April/May.

And as far as American cucks are concerned, they're both the ""Amazon of China."" Just in slightly different ways or some BS.

With BABA reporting tomorrow and potentially dropping positive guidance (as per usual), do you think this could provide a bump to JD stock price? I'm inclined to drop some cash on JD FDs. Just wanna see if any of you special autists have some thoughts that might sway me.

Edit: Additional DD below

Again, I know they are different in a lot of ways, but valuations could theoretically still be viewed in the same way. If we use revenue only, BABA has an annual revenue of $25B a year with a valuation over $500B. This is a 20:1 revenue to valuation ratio. JD has an annual revenue of ~$41B and a valuation of just over $71B. That's under 2:1. The huge difference is that BABA is currently profitable and JD has historically not been. The huge factor that should play into the future is that JD has promised that it's done setting up infrastructure and is now ready to focus on income, meaning it should turn profitable in 2018. The question is by how much. And will their revenue continue to grow as fast if they slow on infrastructure growth. 

Like I said, I'm bullish on both thoughts. Just thinking this might be an opportunity for JD to run a little given the valuation potential in comparison with BABA. And it's fair to relate them, cause ya know, they're both Chinese.

I suggest buying UGAZ in the next 5-15 days when it's at it's lowest, and riding the DGAZ rocket for the next 2-3 weeks. 

This is just my opinion, I was holding DGAZ at 20, 19, and 17 and only have 10 shares. 

I was also holding two UGAZ shares at 70/share and sold at 90/share, the trend was seen last year and the year before that.

p.s. Did I do this right? First time posting on here

EDIT1: I want to say that there will be a dip, as UGAZ had dipped before, but I don't think it will drop as low as 17 again. I think it also won't go as high as last year up to the 100's range, but I think it will jump in the 25-30 range between the next two weeks. Remember to make your gainz and jump off before you get burnt and take this analysis with a grain of salt. Although the pattern has held up for the last five years, it might not gain as significantly as previous years.

EDIT2: I'm not sure why I keep getting down voted, I saw a pattern, I thought it might happen again, and it's been jumping up. It also might not happen. You are welcome to put your opinion and state reasons why I might be false. Also I know shorting gas in winter is risky af.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xwXQ3ogb/

A rally to the upside going into earnings, possibly suggests that people are bullish on the earnings outcome.

Looking at how FB reacts to earnings generally you have about a 5 to 20pt swing around 30 days out before earnings. 

So the outcomes:

1) Assuming you are still bullish on FB and nothing bad happens, There is a good chance that it will play in the range of 188 to 200. 

How to play this:

1) If you're a trader- You can go all in and buy now at $188, with a reasonable expectation for gain to around 192 to 195. Your stop loss should be set to something equivalent to this.

2) As a trader - You can spread your bets, it'll be less gain, but less risk. Put a portion of your trade in at $188 and prepare to buy back in on a dip if it hits 183 to 179 range. Assuming FB is still bullish there is a good chance it will continue to climb.  If trading this, you're recommended to hold for at least 3 months and to have a stop loss in place. Your expected gain after 3 months should be between 195 and 200, so set your stop loss accordingly. 

3) Long term believer - you can just hold and prepare to continue buying at each subsequent level.

If you're looking for a sell off (whether it be bearish or just looking for a swing) 

1) Start planning your shorts from 188 to 200. with this, you need to have a stop loss in place.

Option plays  3months out - 

Bullish: Reasonable price 200 to 210 expectation.

1) If you're bullish, I'd consider buying a NTM call spread or ATM $5 or $10 wide spread. I'd think that 195/ 200 call spread is your best bang for your buck. @ 1.5 to 1.75 your return is around 200% if it hits the 200 to 210 price expectation.  If you want to just do a long call without the spread, you should consider waiting to buy just after earnings (assuming it doesn't rally), this way the prices should be cheaper. 

2) if you're bearish, just follow the opposite. 

In the end you can always build off of this, this is just an idea of what you should consider.

Good luck

After decreased guidance due to Amazon (one of their biggest customers) decreasing demand on their 40G fiber, it has been free falling since August from $100 to currently $38,37.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaoi

I have been doing the dirty job for you to catch and baghold this POS at $60, $50, $40 and $38. It finally seems to have consolidated with a support a bit above $37. Also for the past week volume has been very low compared to average and according to finviz it has a short float of 60%. So on good news this should burst.

The risk is that they were too dependent on Amazon, the company fundamentals seems to be solid and undervalued at the moment due to FUD. Current P/E=9, forward P/E=11, P/S=1.9. Since november some insiders like director Alan Moore have started to get back in in bulk. 

Market sector has been flat-downish, other relevant competitors might be $OCLR or $FNSR.

tl;dr: Possible short squeeze (consolidation, low volume, high short float). Still risky, put stop loss in case it breaks support below $37.

Then I thought great now we are going to see wave 3 but that didnt happen, I mean it started rising and then I broke down and retraced pretty much. What is my mistake here, what I'm looking wrong. What do I do in this situations, do I start counting new elliots from this last retracement or what.

Meaning we are on our 6th day in a row of VIX flirting sub 10. In 2017 that happened twice. But if you look at daily data, in 2017 VIX had only a 3 day streak of not ever surpassing 10 twice, one of which ended its streak at 3 days, the other at 4 days. So we are in territory that has never occurred during 2017, even though it was a year with record low vol. Its obviously a gamble, but it feels like a very safe gamble to say go in on volatility in hopes of a spike this week.

With a modest spike up to a measly 11, based on past performance, a gain of at least 5% could be seen, and if you have huge balls and hop in to UVXY you can double that gain.
Obviously it’s no miracle 20% or 50% gainz, but hey maybe Papa Kim Long VIX tests a nuke and gives you some real action.

After you’ve made some tendies, hop in on XIV and wait until we are sub 10, we’ll, then rinse repeat.

TLDR: based on historical patterns in the VIX, now is the time to long volatility.

In my opinion, they are still trading at a high premium for their industry and are ripe for a comedown. They have a P/E more than double the rest of the industry, slowing sales and growth, and are just now entering a turn around with a new CEO that will make things get worse before they get better as they restructure. Regardless, they lost consumer trust and just had another outbreak in DEC 20th. This outbreak was AFTER they had a terrible Q3 earnings (worst ever for them) which brought the price down from 330 to about ~295. It has now climbed back up to the 320 level but will be hammered again once earning come out Jan 31st. Only issue is the puts are expensive and the volume isnt great, but the IV is below 40%.

Exhibit A: https://mobile.twitter.com/jimcramer/status/950841283811176448
Cramer essentially calling MU management liars. Why would he do this? Look below

Exhibit B:   
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-analysts-forget-sandisk-143735718.html 
Cramer calling current MU CEO Sanjay ""second rate"" back when Sanjay was CEO of Sandisk. Cramer clearly lost money from believing in Sanjay or Sandisk. ALSO - keep in mind Sandisk later sold for 18 billion in 2016. I wanna say the stock recovered to about $78 after being in the low $50s - $60s. Who wants to bet Cramer had already washed his hands of Sandisk and didnt get those sweet tendie gains from the sale.

TLDR: Cramer got cucked by Sanjay but didnt enjoy it hence his incessant moaning on twitter about $MU",,7paxxh,,0,,false,1518515813,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7paxxh/cramer_cucked_by_sanjay_in_2015/,,,,,

https://www.mediafire.com/file/a3fu6slrdddb88u/US_Equity_Strategy_in_Pictures.pdf

It's a long read, and I'm not done with it yet, but here are some highlights:

S&amp;P 500 price target raised to 3,000 for 2018

Market doesn't to be at euphoric levels to cause concern, yet

Equities still widely cheaper than bonds

Quality stocks may be underpriced, a huge potential win

What the cash repatriation may lead to

No 5% correction yet is odd, but if it happens it might not represent the end of the bull market but signal the late stage of it. Some of the best bull run returns come in the final year.

Bond flows well outpacing equity flows

While analyst are bullish, forward P/E may be high as prices have outpaced increased earnings and some firms are still adjusting their models for increased earnings due to tax bill

S&amp;P 500 statistically expensive relative to past years

Expect this year an opportunity to buy S&amp;P 500 5-10% off it's highs due to a pullback

11 of 19 bear market indicators have been triggered

Tax reform was largely priced in at the start of the year on a price standpoint, but price/earnings estimates may be revised upwards as firms include tax related aspects into their estimates

Tax reform may add 10-11% to EPS for 2018. Discretionary and telecom the biggest benefiters

Weary that tax reform benefit for financials (thought of having the biggest impact) will remain due to competition

Tax reform good for small caps, but large caps have pricing power while small caps competition is tough

Net margins for companies look **extremely** good and are at all time highs

Sector opinions:

* **Overweight**: Information Technology, Materials, Financials

* **Marketweight**: Health Care, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Energy, Telecom

* **Underweight**: Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, Utilities 

Sector specific highlights:

Overweight

Tech: semiconductors and tech hardware

Materials: Metals &amp; Mining, Chemicals

Financials: banks and cap markets

Marketweight

Consumer staples: Food &amp; Staples Retailing

Industrials: Machinery

Underweight

RE: Specialty REITs

Tech only sector with positive net cash (cash - debt)

Companies likely to use repatriated and excess cash to pay down debt instead of buyback shares or companies

Watch out for surprise inflation; would lead to quicker fed tightening than expected, and be a strong bear market signal.

Wage inflation has put some pressure on margins

Tax break/cash windfall has companies looking more towards one-time employee bonuses and wage increases than capex

Large caps over small caps

Dividend growth over high dividend yield

So I have been diligently studying investing strategies and naturally decided all in on MU is the way to go. I sold all my shitty stocks and went all in at $47 or so.

Then the inexplicable happened, MU went down. I thought that maybe I had it wrong and should buy my shitty shares back. Then I thought about the odds of me being wrong and laughed. Clearly I wasn't wrong to buy it, the market just didn't know how to value it properly, so I wanted to buy more so I'd be richer when the market caught on. I didn't have any more money though so I sold some MU stock to buy MU options.

My problem is that this has happened like 4 times now and I don't have many MU shares left to sell, to buy MU options.

Ignore the shares - I transferred them in so TDA thinks I got them for free or something.

I definitely think we'll see an ER run-up back to high 170s and am willing to hold at least some of these through ER. I think all the analyst chatter about iPhone X being a flop is just creating more room for a surprise to the upside. 

Obviously the pure play is just buy infinity more calls but I'm wondering if there's some kinda spread play I could set up to make things a little less lopsided. Like if I wanted to sell some contracts how would I capture max IV?

...and I bought puts as a joke a few days ago when it started dropping like a rock from 179 and have made maybe $700 this week just cashing them out and buying a couple more cheap ones at the next lowest strike, and also picking up more calls along the way.

In October, Danaher $DHR reported Q3 earnings of $1.00 per share. That beat Wall Street’s forecast by five cents per share. Previously, the company told us to expect Q3 earnings to range between 92 and 96 cents per share.

Back in July, Danaher raised its full-year guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 per share. Which was revised higher. Danaher raised its full-year guidance to a range of $3.96 to $4.00. Working out the math, that means they expect $1.12 to $1.16 per share for Q4. Danaher’s CEO recently said he sees earnings coming in at the higher end of that range. 

**Check Point Software $CHKP**

Shares of Check Point Software $CHKP got clobbered when the last earnings report came out. The Q3 earnings were fine, but the outlook wasn’t so hot. For Q4, Check Point sees earnings between $1.45 and $1.55 per share and revenue between $485 million and $525 million. Expecting volatility on the higher range of the band. *long straddle 

**Stryker $SYK**

In October, Stryker $SYK reported Q3 earnings of $1.52 per share, two cents better than estimates. For Q4, they expect $1.92 to $1.97 per share. Stryker sees full-year earnings in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share. Forex costs will be about 10 cents per share for the year.

Stryker recently raised its quarterly dividend by 11%. The payout went from 42.5 to 47 cents per share. The orthopedics company has raised its dividend every year since 1993.

**AFLAC $AFL**

The stock will report earnings on Wednesday, January 31. The CEO said that if the yen averages between 110 and 115 to the dollar, they expect Q4 earnings between $1.42 and $1.66 per share. Wall Street expects $1.55 per share. For 2018, they see operating earnings between $6.65 and $6.95 per share. That’s based on the yen averaging 112 to the dollar this year.

Now here is the part where it gets interesting published January, 12 / Marketwatch

*Shares of $AFL umbled 7.1% in active afternoon trade Friday, although the insurer said a report that former employees alleged fraud and abuse was ""false"" and ""without merit."" Volume spiked to 10.5 million shares, or more than 6-times the full-day average. The stock, which closed at a record $91.69 on Thursday, pared earlier intraday losses of as much as 8.7%. ""Recent media stories regarding Aflac contain false allegations made by a very small group of independent contractors. Aflac intends to aggressively fight these allegations beginning with filing for their dismissal,"" the company said in a statement.* 

*A report by The Intercept said Aflac exploited workers, manipulated accounting and deceived shareholders and customers, citing multiple current and former employees, as well as three previously unreported lawsuits. In Aflac's response, the company said it has ""investigated these claims and found them to be without merit.""*

Manipulated Accounting !??! Time to have a detailed look at their books.

I'm ignorant of the other sectors. All I know about is tech. The estimate for $CMG doesn't seem optimistic (rightly so). It's low enough that they could beat it easily. I imagine holidays bring a boom to the food/service industry.

Some market participants pointed to ongoing speculation that a buyer might surface to make an offer for the social media company. Yet the more interesting news came from Citron Research, which made a rare bullish call and suggested that the stock could climb to $35 per share, or roughly $13 higher than where Twitter started the day. Citron fueled the merger rumors by suggesting that a Chinese counterpart in social media might bid for Twitter. Given that Citron has built its reputation on being on the short side of the trading book when it comes to its analysis, its talking up Twitter is particularly noteworthy.

December 30th 2017 - when the post was made

AAPL APR 20th Calls

175 @6.50 premium

150 @22.05 premium

AAPL currently trading at 169.20


January 20th 2018 - today

AAPL APR 20th Calls

175 @10.05 premium = 54.61% increase

150 @29.50 premium = 33.78% increase

AAPL currently trading at 178.46

Yes, 33% is less than 54%

Yes, I am a pussy faggot for not buying OTM

but I'd rather earn a bit less with reduced risk.

Here are the results (With screens),"[Gains/Losses] (https://imgur.com/a/DYUeK)



[Loan](https://imgur.com/a/MX8H1)

I started trading in February of last year. My initial investment was building with regular deposits and got up to $36,954 by December.

After the great tech crash (late nov early dec), my initial investment went down to $20,429 (45% loss). I was invested with something like 4x margin in all tech. Before the crash, my portfolio was worth $56,566 (65% return).

In a depressed drunken stupor, I decided to apply for a personal loan and either get my money back or go down in a glorious ball of flames.

So far I have made back my initial investment in the first trading week of 2018 + 9k. I plan to pay back the loan in full Feb 2, 2018 for a total cost of ~$2k interest. 

Holdings during this period: SQ, SHOP, NVDA, YUMC, AMD, STZ (loss)
