My question regards Triple Leveraged ETF's but mainly TQQQ in particular. It is my understanding that TQQQ uses leveraged funds to prop up the value of its shares to mimic the returns of large cap tech companies. I also realize that the 3x leverage does not necessarily correlate to 3x the yield of the matching index. Would someone be kind enough to fill in some missing details and miscellaneous information? In the most basic sense, I believe this fund is borrowing a bunch of money from investors to attempt to mitigate fluctuations in the market.

I don't entirely understand what makes an ETF a triple threat, but I really want to go long on this. Thoughts?

Circuit Breakers

In response to the market breaks in October 1987 and October 1989, the New York Stock Exchange instituted circuit breakers to reduce volatility and promote investor confidence. By implementing a pause in trading, investors are given time to assimilate incoming information and the ability to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.

NYSE Rule 80B provides that a circuit-breaker halt for a Level 1 (7%) or Level 2 (13%) decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index occurring after 9:30 a.m. Eastern and up to and including 3:25 p.m. Eastern, or in the case of an early scheduled close, 12:25 p.m. Eastern, would result in a trading halt in all stocks for 15 minutes. If the S&amp;P 500 Index declines by 20%, triggering a Level 3 circuit-breaker, at any time, trading would be halted for the remainder of the day.

A Level 1 or Level 2 halt can only occur once per trading day. For example, following the reopening of trading after a Level 1 Market Decline halt, the NYSE would not halt the market again unless a Level 2 Market Decline was to occur. Likewise, following the reopening of trading after a Level 2 Market Decline, the NYSE would not halt trading again unless a Level 3 Market Decline were to occur, at which point, trading in all stocks would be halted until the primary market opens the next trading day.

Outlook:

	2018 is due to be a big year for Martin Marietta Materials. Following the passage of President Trump’s historic tax overhaul, the President’s persistence is now focused on pushing his infrastructure agenda through Capitol Hill. It is anticipated that President Trump’s infrastructure spending bill will reap numerous benefits for the U.S. Economy and U.S. firms that are leaders in the infrastructure repair and rebuild sector alike. In my opinion, President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts bill overhaul, combined with mass infrastructure spending, will improve both GDP and consumer confidence.   
          The increase in GDP will be a ancillary result of an increase in government spending - due to the spending increase inherent in the Bill.  An increase in GDP will also, in turn, inspire consumer confidence as a byproduct, which is certain to encourage startups, manufacturing and inventory expansion, and overall growth in many sectors of the US economy. In addition, an increase in personal consumption attributed not only to government contracting in the private industry, but also to personal and business tax cuts, will give certain domestic industries that have been impacted by price/cost downward pressures, evidenced by the absolutely stagnant rate of inflation for the past 8 years, some breathing room on inventory and pricing increase.   
        One sector of these industries that will be positively impacted will be the aggregates and heavy materials building companies. Due to massive cutbacks in the DOT - employment went from 16k to 10k in 10 years - it is likely that the DOT will need to begin outsourcing differently, and will likely turn to the U.S. private sector to advance the pace of infrastructure work that the Trump Administration has prioritized for US cities and highways, infrastructure repairs, and rebuilds. It is my opinion that industry-leading basic materials firms like Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials will be well-positioned to garner the lion’s share of these contracts. The decision between the two companies will come down to competitive bidding, as well as to preexisting established relationships with the current Presidential Administration

$BTU largest coal operations firm in the World

Outlook:

	Earning call is February 7, 2018. -15.9% projected revenue growth provides evidence that $BTU will struggle to meet revenue estimates. $BTU is highly leveraged with a debt/equity ratio of over 2500%. Additionally $BTU has a negative return on equity ( -18.2%) and assets (-.09). $BTU’s trading and brokerage operations reported a revenue loss of -10.90M. $BTU’s projected 3 year revenue growth in its U.S. and Australian mining operations are -11.33% and -12.96%, respectively, which reflects a gross misallocation of resources. Under, “Other” operations, generating revenue of $19.10M in 2016, reported a projected 3 year revenue growth of -20.40%.

The competitive nature of Natural Gas prices pose a threat to coal consumption which could lead to a global oversupply. $BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. 

Additionally, $BTU’s current stream of revenue, as well as future revenue growth, put to question whether or not $BTU faces a general opportunity cost: whether or not C02 allowances are worth their cost when considering revenue declines.

One should also take into consideration the current and forecasted decline in US coal consumption and exports. This may be attributed to an increased use in natural gas and recent cost reductions concerning renewable energy.

$BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. Additionally, $BTU is one of the only firms which does not run operations out of the appalachians.

Around 2PM i put in an order for 0day SPXW 2/5 2710 Put for $5.10. I didnt think it filled and i thought I canceled it. The markets started acting crazy so i decided to just sit the day out and not trade. At 8PM i decided to log in to check my mutual funds updated NAV for the day to see how much i lost. Turns out the order i thought i canceled actually filled and since it was for todays expiration is worth about $6200 for a profit of about $5700 or ~1100% (fidelity is basing value off of the current after hours bid which is inaccurate. actual profit is 1100%. it expired at close so tomorrow my account will be credited $6200)

This is my most profitable trading day ever because I am a conservative loser who has 30K in a mutual fund and the other 50K in cash and it was completely by accident. If I knew it filled i probably would have ended up selling it for a $100 loss 5 mins later.

So last Friday, I bought some Feb 14 calls of the VIX with a strike price of 17. This was close to at the money I believe.

Today, as you all know, VIX jumped to over $37 by end of day. I decided to realize my gains sold my calls for just under 360% gain. I was ecstatic with the return.

But...now that I think about it...I had bought the calls for 1.50 each, and sold for 6.90. That's a gain of $540/contract.

But what if I just exercised the option? I would have bought 100 shares at $17, and immediately sold them for $37...that's $2000 gain per/contract.

Am I missing something? I've never exercised an option before, pretty new to derivatives altogether. I thought I'd learn by getting my toes wet with the VIX and got lucky. I thought in-the-money options were priced with the gain embedded so that it would be easier to sell the option and realize the same gain than if I exercised it.

Either way, I'm happen with the most profitable trade in my short trading career, but I'd like to know how to prevent this mistake again if it was in fact a mistake on my part.

Mad props to whoever that came up with it. 

I'm not sure if the logo has been discussed before, but the WSB kid was dressed up as ""Old Master Q"", a ridiculously popular Hong Kong comic series that began in the 1960s. It has a sizeable following among the Chinese diaspora and is considered a cultural icon.

I really can't think of a contemporary US equivalent but he is generally not described as an exemplary figure, nor is he someone regularly portrayed as someone related to the stock market.

I don't even know if Old Master Q comics are sold in the states or whether the humour would work over there.

Someone's gotta put those tendies on the table right?

*ASSUMING WE HAVE A GREEN DAY/GREEN WEEK(s)*


**VIX Puts**

Jumped **6** points Friday and **19** points Monday.

Trading at **39.XX**(4:48AM EST) Closed @ 37

52 Week average is between 13-10

With this I'm confident it wouldn't instantly drop back to the teens(11-19), I believe that if we have a half decent day, we might get to 21-25, but that's only today, if the green continues we could hit upper teens.  I wouldn't go for February 7th, that's extremely ballsy and certainly plenty of money to make in this volatility, but you could also be donating your money to Goldman Sachs if the market flips.

**In short** I'm looking at February 14th or 21st 21-24P

 **UVXY Puts**

Jumped **3** points Friday and **11** points Monday

Trading at **28.XX**(5:07AM EST)  Closed @ 22

52 Week average is between 14-16

I really don't think this would drop AS hard as $VIX would, but I could be wrong.  I'd be more willing to purchase 1-2 month out puts on this but give me your ideas.

**In short** I'm looking at March-April 18-20P

**TQQQ/QQQ Calls**

TQQQ dropped **8** points Friday and **15** points Monday

$TQQQ trades at 140.xx(5:18AM EST)

QQQ dropped **3** points Friday and **5** points Monday

$QQQ trades at 157.xx(5:18AM EST)

I grouped these together because TQQQ is a 3x leveraged QQQ, if you're new here you might not know that.  We choose to jerk these two off till their raw meat.  Between these two aim pretty torn.  On one hand I feel this market is already bringing enough volatility, so no need to 3x it with TQQQ, but on the other, if you pick right you could make away huge.  It's really up to you on how safe you're feeling.  Looking at the premiums right now though, these look pretty overvalued to me.  You have strike prices and premiums that have a massive jump almost already priced in.  Let me know what you think though.

**SPY/SPX**  

These ones have also had their fair share of beatings as of late, but it seems, in my opinion, maybe you differ, that it's too late to get in these at a solid price.  You have crazy premiums spread out everywhere.  Tell me what you think though.

I currently have a long position at 16.9$ on Silver because I believe that the depreciation of the USD will continue however I'm still somewhat hesitant due to the ongoing daily manipulation which they endure. Been trading them for 5/6 months and 9 times out of 10 they tank as soon as Wall Street opens, doesn't matter how the USDX is performing or how the stocks are doing. This isn't some tin foil conspiracy theory and it has been proven several times.

_______________________________________________________
Stock indexes around the world continued to plunge Monday, but investors point to one reassuring factor in global markets: People aren’t getting nervous about corporate credit.

The difference between yields on corporate bonds and less risky government debt continues to narrow, suggesting that share-price declines aren’t because of widespread fears about the financial health of the world’s companies.

Previous U.S. equity-market corrections since the 2008 credit crisis have been matched by big moves in corporate-credit spreads, as investors sought a higher premium over government bonds to compensate for their increased concerns over corporate health.


Spreads on dollar- and euro-denominated corporate credit ticked down to their lowest levels since 2007 Friday, indicating that bond buyers don’t currently require a greater payoff against the risk that such debt defaults.

For example, while Apple Inc.’s stock is now down about 7.5% in the year to date, spreads on the company’s 2027 bonds have dropped to 0.59 percentage point Monday from 0.65 percentage point at the beginning of the year.

U.S. corporate bonds offered yields just 1.1 percentage points more than government bonds of the same maturity, according to IHS Markit ’s iBoxx indexes, barely higher than Friday’s 1.08 points, the lowest level seen since 2007.

The spread on European corporate bonds was even lower on Friday, at just 0.82 percentage point.

On Monday, European, Asian and U.S. stocks fell again. The Stoxx Europe 600 sank 1.6%, the largest drop in a year and a half, Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average fell 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500 slid 4.1%. The spread on European corporate bonds barely budged, ending at 0.83 percentage point.

“I think the resilience of credit to the most recent selloff within equity should provide equity investors with a little bit of comfort,” said David Riley, head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management.

“It suggests credit investors still feel very comfortable with corporate-credit fundamentals, the earnings outlook and the ability of the corporate sector to absorb higher rates,” he added.

During previous market turns like the nearly 14% drop of the S&amp;P 500 in February 2016 from its May 2015 high, the spread on the iBoxx U.S. corporate index rose by nearly 0.9 of a percentage point.

Similarly, during the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, when the S&amp;P 500 dropped 18%, corporate spreads rose 1.7 percentage points.

To be sure, those share-price declines were far larger than the drawdown in global equities over the past week.

But so far, there is little indication that the selloffs are based on expectations of significantly deteriorating economic conditions and company profits are mostly beating expectations. With roughly half of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported their fourth-quarter earnings, 78% have beat analysts’ expectations, compared with 64% in a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

“Really, there is no recessionary risk out there that’s telling you not to invest in bonds paid for by the cash flow of companies,” said Ewan McAlpine, senior client portfolio manager at Royal London Asset Management.

Data on Monday continued to point to an acceleration in global growth that should be supportive for both stocks and credit. The IHS Markit eurozone January purchasing-managers index reached its highest level since June 2006, while the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing PMI rose to 59.9, well above the 56.5 expected.

The credit market “is a supportive factor in my view that I don’t think we’ve hit the turn in the equity markets,” said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.

So why are stocks falling?

The difference between the two asset classes this week may in part reflect stocks’ more exuberant start to the year. Equity markets drew record inflows and the S&amp;P 500 rose 5.6% in January, its biggest monthly gain since March 2016. Since the beginning of the year, credit spreads on both the euro and dollar iBoxx corporate indexes have declined by roughly 0.1 percentage point.

“All of the discussion at the moment that is negative about the equity market, none of it is about the economics, it’s all about those valuations and ratios,” Mr. McAlpine said.

Investors have been debating whether U.S. stocks look expensive, and what valuation should be used to measure that. The S&amp;P 500’s 12-month rolling price/earnings ratio, a popular valuation measure, reached 23.4 in January, its highest level since 2002.


On Monday, S&amp;P Global Ratings warned that the global proportion of highly leveraged companies, with a debt-to-earnings ratio above 5 to 1, has risen by 5 percentage points since 2007, to 37%.

Higher debt levels leave companies vulnerable to unexpected fast increases in interest rates, which would make it more costly to pay off their debt.

“When you are seeing this type of volatility, it does raise the question of whether credit spreads should be trading near all-time tights,” said Sunil Krishnan, head of multiassets funds at Aviva Investors. “I don’t think you’re getting very good compensation for volatility.”",,7vnseo,,0,,false,1520495806,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7vnseo/credit_markets_to_stock_investors_calm_down_wsj/,,Likes to watch others stock picks,,,

XIV is ETN so as long as it just mimicks the move of the underlying, issuer was good to go.

So, when NAV went to $3, ProShares didn't have any incentive to liquidate the assets and loose chance to earn the fees. XIV on the other hand being an ETN (was probably not backed up by real assets) and hence when Credit Suisse ran into loss with whatever dollar it had set aside, it decided to scuttle it. 

Another reason is if you looked at the short holdings of SVXY vs XIV on Feb 5, XIV had higher percentage short of Feb contracts and less of Mar contracts. SVXY on the other hand was more short of Mar contracts. Feb contracts had exploded 75% and Mar had exploded 50%. XIV thus had to buy much more of expensive one. What that makes me think is XIV was probably being mismanaged. Again they can choose to mismanage it as there is no real underlying that they keep at a bank. XIV and SVXY were supposed to move in tandem.

Edit: Even if XIV had the provision to liquidate, Credit Suisse wouldn't want to liquidate it if it had any positive NAV left as it generates fees. ",,7vrl1v,,0,,false,1520497914,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7vrl1v/how_svxy_survived_and_xiv_didnt/,,,,,

Now I have 100 shares of Company A, Sell Covered Calls OTM.
Above Strike: Exercised, premium and capital gains, get money back and sell cash secured puts again.
Below Strike: Premium. Sell covered call again if stock hasn’t dropped dramatically. If drops hard, well fuck. I chose a dividend stock.

Can anyone find more faults in this? I want to do this, but the weakness is if the stock drops dramatically while selling covered calls then I’m screwed. Since if it drops too much I am unable to sell at a strike price above what I got the stock for.

I am always skeptical, but, using optionsprofitcalculator.com you can see an approximate of what you can expect in profit when trading SPX options and if you're buying 10% OTM short term, &lt;3 to 4 months, you can have 1000% gains also. Still not sure how he has 2500% though.

Anyway, If I am correct in what this guy did is, he more or less went 10% OTM with a 4 month time frame. That's really the only way you're going to see this type of return and the return on these ones is only 1000% . So, I'm not really sure how he made twice that.  Give him benefit of the doubt, unless he cares to share. I'll just assume he was able to do this because of low implied volatility.

Using this calculator 
http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

Lets say he started in November and bought January 31, 10% OTM calls. He'd be paying between $3.00 to $6.00 per contract.  Option prices are priced pretty fairly.

For calculation, lets use what they have as the mid of the bid/ask $3.70 . The range today is 3.70 to 4.30

This would give you the following:

*  SPX @ 2779
* 10% @ 3056
* 270 contracts 
* 4.5 to 5 month expiration. June 15 contracts.
* Total spent: approx. $100,000


The earliest reasonable time you'll hit $1000000 is Between April 16 to April 26 @ 3050. This means it'll have to gain  to 9% in 2.5 months.  approx. 4% per month.

The most probable time  that you'll hit $100000 is end of May if the market averages 2.75% per month.

The latest time you can cash out as a millionaire is at the end and only if the SPX hits $3120, a gain of 12%.

Now, lets say IV affects option prices by lowering the price by half.

You'd get these contracts for around 1.85 to 1.90

The earliest you'd get to cash at as a millionaire is after 1.5 months with the SPX being required to gain 6%. 

The most reasonable/probably time you'd be able to cash out as a millionaire is May 1, with the spx being required to gain around 2% per month.

** CONCLUSION ** And plot twist.

The market must gain between approx 2.25 - 3% per month in 3 months out of a 4 month expiration  OR in 4 months out of 5 months expiration and you must be paying at maximum 3.70 per contract in order to hit that 1000% within the 3 month time frame and the 10% OTM contract. To hit that 2500% you need to be able to buy these options at 50% of the price. 
 
 Based on what he said is, he started buying in November and sold sometime in January. This meant:

* 4 month time frame
* Had to have bought at around 2600 all of them beginning of November.
* Bought them at 10% OTM 2860 strikes
* Market gained 10.7% in 2.5 months.
* ALL contracts had to have been &lt;$2.40 . 

This gets you 2000% return.  

Now maybe this guy is lucky, but in my research, even using the JUNE 15, 2018 calls which is as close as it gets. The lowest these contracts dropped was to $2.40 and that was with that small correction.  

Even if you use a $2.00 price per contract, the earliest you can get to 2500% is 2.5 months of a 4 month expiration. If the market gains 9 to 10% in that time frame.

If you do a 15% OTM option because they are half the price @ $1.00 per contraction, the only way you'd hit 1000% is if you hit 8% in less than one month.

Eh, based on this, I don't know how this dude did 2500%, but I'd like to see what strike, expiration, and when he bought the entire lot with the 100k.

 Maybe I am missing something? But what do I know, I am not a millionaire.

Its not impossible to hit that Millionaire status with 100k. You'd have to be 10% OTM and have the market gain 9% in 3 months of a 4 month expiration or 2.5% per month in 4 months of a 5 month expiration. This will just give the approximate 1000%.


Good luck all!

I sell a March 2 put spread 240 and 237.5. This means that if $NVDA stays above 240 I get to keep the money that I collected from selling the put spread. 

IF I do this every week with 66% chance of profit that means that every 2 out of 3 times I will make money so in the long run this might be a profitable strategy especially because $NVDA will be $348 next year according to u/TygerWithAWhy

I know it's a dying company, but these numbers are too good to pass up. Positive trends in the underlying business, namely nintendo switch-driven foot traffic will allow for earnings growth in 2018, and updated guidance from tax reform will be the catalyst to create a short squeeze from earnings in about a month. Remember how retail popped like 20% after tax reform? GME is the forgotten hero of retail.

GME is a dying business, but it's just not dying that fast. You can compare it to Sear's, seeing consistent double digit sales declines. GME on the other hand saw sales growth in 2017, largely from their-low margin hardware business, but also from new release games, collectibles, digital sales, game accessories, etc. that have more than offset the decline in the used game business, which by the way is dying, but at a relatively healthy single-digit percentage pace. MSFT is doing some cool backwards compatibility stuff with the Xbox One Plus that allow old games to be played with modern graphics and this could stem the decline of Gamestop's used game business. GME also has an AT&amp;T-branded store business which is nothing interesting and probably was a bad acquisition, but it earns money and leverages SG&amp;A.

Management has done an amazing job of sticking around in a dying business. There's a new CEO because the old one is in the hospital, which is too bad and hopefully he can recover and lead GME to the new golden age.

Well, the answer to the question you didn't ask is **food delivery.** In 2017, it grew 50% with no signs of slowing down. The more food is delivered, the cheaper delivery becomes, the more people use it, etc. It's the Amazon flywheel all over again. 

The question becomes: How to benefit from this trend? I think this is fantastic for the fast food giants that didn't have delivery before. MCD, YUM, QSR, all of which are primed to pump food out at volume and trade at very reasonable valuations. Delivery was a huge boon to the pizza industry, and it will be an even bigger boon to fast food companies that can grow without doing an ounce of CapEx to build out a delivery network. I think going long these companies is the best play in this space, since there is almost no downside at these valuations, and vast upside. I'm especially bullish on MCD since they have been killing it by every single metric.

The other compelling play is to long GRUB. These guys have been growing at 30%, just posted monstrously good user growth numbers(77% increase!!), and also signed a deal with YUM, which is obviously a huge deal. I think GRUB is fantastic and going to grow. According to McKinsey, 80% of users who sign up with a delivery app stick with it, and this creates very important winner-take-all effects. UberEats has become a very strong competitor, but it does not appear to be stopping GRUB.",,7zl47p,,0,,false,1520583509,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7zl47p/lets_talk_food_delivery/,,,,,

*bolded are the memes*



1ST: **JD**

2ND: INTC

3RD: **MU**

4: **SQ**

5: MTCH

.

.

.

6th: **AMD**


The motto of the week was ""no child left behind,"" as MU, INTC, and SQ raced neck and neck battling each other for the silver and bronze and papa Qiangdong stood steady at the helm of his ship, the *SS JD*. 

As the market whiplashed all week, MU steadily drove ahead, passing by carcasses of resistances of past at 44,45,46 to close the week strongly entrenched in the high 46s. 

SQ entered the week with strength, hitting the mid 46s before tumbling the remainder of the week and closing a stagnant flat af overall week. They report on Tuesday 2/27, and this may jump them into anywhere on the leadership board except for behind the Queen of retards herself, SuBae. 

INTC too, like its sibling MU, took a late midweek shit before jumping out of the gates Friday and closing in on JD. Look out JD! Intel is closing in quickly. Maybe someone can fuck up another one of their products and report it to google so MU jumps into second.   

I regret not getting in on MTCH and looking at their chart gets me pissed so I have nothing to say about them. Way back at 41 though. 

AMD was pretty much whatever this week. As whatever as they've been in the past year, tbh. No one gives a shit and they prob won't even get a participation ribbon. 

Look for the following update next friday, or if someone wins before then, idk. 

Does China win the gold? Or does the US come back with a steath victory?

This dramatically lowered IV and options prices across the board. Option holders got robbed (longer term and out of money options on UVXY declined a lot today despite a big spike in the VIX as a result of this). How is that legal? Could they have lowered the target objective to .0001x? To reflect the return of an Ally high yield savings account? It doesn't seem like they should be able to change funds like that when options IV is based upon what the underlying asset consists of.

KXS – Kinaxis

Business – IT company providing supply chain management software. 

Market Cap ~2B CAD

Price - $86.80
52 week high - $91.98  (May 30 2017)

Rationale:

1.    Strong 3 year growth trend

2.    Recent contract with Toyota (January 2018) – contract is to replace all of Toyota’s existing supply chain management software with Kinaxis’ software.  This wont be in earnings, but gives their software a quality stamp of approval.

3.    Average analyst price target is 91.50

4.    Earnings today after the close,  EPS forecast seems reasonable to be beaten

 

Exit:

1.    This is an earnings play.  If they beat today, you should see a pop on Thursday and continued rally.

2.    If they miss today or guidance is poor, I would exit on Thursday’s open.

3.    So there is no stop loss for today.  Thursday will tell you the outcome.


Edit - 
Results - Adjusted EPS $0.30/share.  
Estimate - 0.28

Forward guidance has 20% revenue growth. Looks pretty good. ",,80xuk7,,0,,false,1520610119,false,self,t5_2th52,false,stocks,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/80xuk7/snow_mexican_stock_tip_tsekxs_kinaxis_inc/,,,,Stocks,

1. Recent bump is robots responding to Q4. The company itself has only lost money in the last 8 months yet the stock climbs because of ""positive revenue reports"" and big investors are buying ownership. The net loss they put up this year is almost identical to 2015, yet everyone wants in?
2. Q1 18 will be a mess. Seasonal drop plus DD below will demolish investor confidence, especially if there's another ruling on the lawsuit they're almost certainly going to lose. Their quarterlies show they burn through liquid assets early in the year.
3. Mean price sits at $13 and once the professional pump is done, it'll dump.
4. $37 million (71.6% of total revenue) from 2017 is sitting in unbilled receivables, muss less than 2016 ($13m) and 2015 ($6.8m).
5. $40m in debts are due this year and they currently have no way of paying it. They'll dig themselves deeper.

Now, on a more tinfoily note, in IO's report, they mentioned that unbilled receivables were ""significantly estimated and subjective"". As many know, when unbilled receivables grow faster than sales or billed receivables it can indicate that a greater portion of revenue may be coming from sales under the percentage-of-completion method, which [has been used to fraudulently hide ""problem projects with excessive costs""](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17815.htm). So what's costing so much?

The company's ""Multi-Client Library"". They're claiming to have nearly QUADRUPLED (27m to 100.8m from 2016 to 2017) the revenue from ""New Ventures"" which is revenue calculated by its costs, not from actual dollars earned. And that 100.8m number is still double what they ""earned"" on New Ventures in 2015 (48.3m) and yet their annual report claims that their costs of services and products decreased from 180m to 103m (between 2015 and 2017). Providing more services, doing more business, and spending less to do it? They've literally said New Ventures are exclusively about performing surveys (it can't grow without expenses while, royalties, for instance could easily do that), so if that composes the enormous increase in revenue, how could there be a decrease in expenses?

The way they valuate and amortize the survey library ""consists of determining the percentage of actual revenue recognized to the total estimated revenues (which includes both revenues **estimated to be realized during the New Venture phase and estimated revenues from the licensing of the resulting “on-the-shelf” data survey**) and multiplying that percentage by the **total cost** of the project (the sales forecast method)."" If the expenses for getting the surveys declined, and the revenue from the surveys went up, and the valuation of the library as calculated by the total cost of the projects and the projected revenue remains almost the same, then they're either being paid 4x more for this year's surveys or there's some shady reporting going on.

To summarize, I don't think they made all the money they're claiming. They're either faking the surveys they've bought/created (because expenses don't reflect an increase in spending for them) or they've actually spent an assload of money getting them (by claiming tens of millions in unbilled receivables) and can't make ends meet. That estimated revenue, based on the increased expenses and called ""unbilled receivables"", gave them a big boost in revenue in 2017 while revenue for everything else declined. They had to show improvement with the annual report because two days later Invesco spent $27m buying 7.5% of their company. They owe $40m in priority loans in 2018 and so even if real revenue shows up (and seasonally speaking it probably won't) they're still losing big. Not to mention the $120m debt they needed to get past the lost IP lawsuit.

If you just compare 2015 and 2016, unbilled receivables doubled when new ventures revenue was cut in half. And both of them are completely independent from actual service and product expense numbers. I think it's nuts. And it's all being audited by Grant Thornton LLP, who has been charged *multiple times* by the SEC and as recently as 2015, where they ""repeatedly violated professional standards while ignoring repeated red flags and fraud risks that allowed [their clients] to file numerous reports with the Commission that were materially false and misleading. ""

It's a time bomb. Not gonna claim any trades because who gives a shit. It's ATH now so no one's gonna fucking buy in. Inverse me faggots.

EDIT: Editing because /u/Karim_Garcia mentioned the earnings call. The call was pretty straightforward but appears to be deliberately deceptive. They claimed ""[t]his quarter, new venture revenues increased to 174% and data library sales increased 85% compared to the fourth quarter of last year."" As described earlier, New Ventures revenue is defined by its expenses not how much they're being paid and Data Library sales, for the whole year of 2017, went up less than .01% (40m vs. 39.9m). Total net revenues remain virtually unchanged, but they paint it as substantial growth by isolating the last quarter of each year.

EDIT AGAIN: I'm editing because I have too young of an account to actually respond to posts below. /u/Inostranetz I think the poor Q1 2018 is going to shake investor confidence and failing to reap the rewards of all the money they've invested in their New Ventures is going to drop them. They've had a number of acquisition buys by big investors in the last 8 months; I'm guessing one of them is going to sell and get out while the price is $25+ and then after the Q1 2018 earnings call it's gonna tank. The strange thing is, if there isn't anything shady going on, the stock will still tank. The Q&amp;A from the earnings report showed serious skepticism about how they handled the disappearance of their Ocean Bottom Surveying division (reported ZERO revenue in Q4 because of ""reshuffling""). I'm guessing if they don't solve those problems fast they're going to lose their investors. After Q1 or Q2 earnings you'll see people abandoning ship.

EDIT: And now they're issuing more shares to cover their debt. Anyone that got in on a short position before today is gonna make some money.",,7x6fpw,,0,,false,1520527217,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7x6fpw/io_is_a_time_bomb_actual_dd_inside/,,,,,

Why you should invest in Western Union? I don't have that much time on my hands but here are few reasons why you should (it's explained pretty quickly but it's free so stfu) :

- Their revenue didn't move. It can be good (if it's an established company that has stable income) or bad (if the company is yound and is supposed to expand) but in this case, it's good since it's an already established company!

- Their expenses are stable too. This is ok : I would prefer that they had more expenses to show they're trying new things but no rise in expenses is good too.

- Income taxes is decreasing. This is a good thing. Optimizing their taxes! Good for an already established company that don't really need to expand, not good for a young company.

- This point is more of a market psychology. Everything is down. A slight hope in a company and people will throw a lot of money in it to hope for gains.

- We can see that the net income has decreased dramatically showing they now know how to manage their money.

The data of how much margin being used is available. I'm guessing you could probably model where you think it's likely being deployed as well. With that information, the ML algos could easily start predicting at what level of price drops would start causing margin calls. Once margin starts being called, the prices will automatically continue dropping more without manipulation due to the number of autistics without diverse funds.    
    
The best part is that this doesn't even take some super smart guy to figure out this model himself. Instead they're teaching the algos to figure it out, which means it's pretty damn likely they've already deployed these drivers if it's possible. Just wait for some natural event to likely start a drop, then drive it further, then rake in the cash. Think about it; someone was on the other side of all the volatility turds, and made some serious bank.

As of right now, XIV is about 35% off of its all time highs. So, how can one make money off this product?

I'll get started by saying that XIV returned 187% in 2017. In 2016? 80%. It's a compelling product with the ability to produce outsized returns. So, what's the catch? 

XIV sees drawdowns of 50% fairly ""regularly."" It saw a drawdown of &gt;50% in 2011, 2015, and nearing one in 2017 (I may be missing a few dates.) Simulated data shows that XIV would have suffered a drawdown of &gt;90% during the 2008 Financial Crisis.

The question is: ""How can I navigate XIV to avoid those massive drawdowns while still generating outsized returns?""

First, let's break down the basics: 

XIV is an ETN (exchange traded note) issued by Credit Suisse. It tracks a synthetic 30 day weighted VIX future. The index it tracks is ^SPVXSP (check it out on Yahoo Finance or CBOE website). XIV is short the 30 day weighted VIX future. 

XIV makes money in two ways: 

1. Because XIV is ""short volatility,"" it tends to profit when volatility falls. This is fairly straightforward. 
2. ""Roll Yield and Contango"" - The VIX futures term structure (can be found at vixcentral.com) is typically sloped upwards. This means that the further out a VIX future is, the higher the future price tends to be. Because XIV is short the front two months of the term structure, it generally profits from ""contango"" and ""roll yield"". Contango is found by dividing the second month of the VIX futures term structure by the first month (m2/m1), whereas roll yield is found by dividing m1/VIX. These futures that XIV is short tend to ""roll down"" (aka decrease in value) to the spot VIX price over time, leading to a profitable environment for XIV (see 2012, 2016, 2017 for highly profitable years). 

The reason that the VIX futures term structure is usually in contango is because of human nature. People tend to hedge their portfolios buy buying VX calls (calls on VIX futures). They are paying a premium to acquire this ""insurance"" (because call sellers won't take on the risk without being compensated for it). In most cases, nothing too bad happens in the markets and the futures decrease in value, leading to XIV profits. 

So, how does one navigate the volatility environment and avoid massive drawdowns like those seen in 2011, 2015, and now 2017? 

The answer: There are numerous indexes available to give traders a better idea of what is taking place in the VIX futures market. By analyzing these indexes and understanding ""critical points,"" one can get a better idea of when to be long XIV. 

A few of the indexes: 

VIX - The VIX index is easily the most well known of all volatility indexes. It tracks the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 days. 

VXST - Same thing as VIX, except it measures the market's expectation of volatility over the next 9 days. A reading of VXST/VIX &gt; 1 is considered ""scary.""

VIX3M (previously VXV) - Same thing, except it measures the market's expectation of volatility over the next 3 months

VXMT - Measures market's expectation of volatility over the next 6 months

VVIX - Measures the volatility of the VIX index (vol of vol). Tends to ""spike"" during quick sell offs 

Now, none of these indexes are terribly helpful on their own. By developing ratios (VIX/VIX3M, VIX3M/VXMT etc) and understanding how their movement impacts the price of XIV, one can begin to beat a ""buy and hold XIV"" strategy. 


These are the ""basics."" There is much more to learn and understand, but the potential reward is worth it, IMO. Feel free to PM for any additional information or if you have any questions.

If i invest for a shorter period of time, they tax me significantly more.

1. You get $1.85 for every 10 shares (ouch)


2. In addition for every 10 RAD share, you get 1 share of Albertsons.


3. Or you might get 1.079 shares of Albertsons for every 10 shares of Rite Aid. It depends on how some meeting goes.


Well you might ask, how much is a share of Albertsons? Well we know that the difference between the two deals is 0.079, so that means 0.079 shares of Albertsons is worth about $1.85 so about $23 a share. So if my math is correct, does that mean that RAD is being bought out at around $2.4~2.5 a share?

Let's do what we do and put together a list of potential targets so that we can get some of those chicken nugget things y'all talk about. 

I've been following NWL since it sold off when management announced that they're considering selling assets and that they fired 3 board members. NWL owns a shit load of well known brand names: Sharpie,  Elmers, Graco, Paper Mate, Mr. Coffee, Oster, Marmot, Yankee Candle, Calphalon, Rubbermaid, Rawlings, X-Acto, Crockpot, Rainbow, Coleman, K2 … 

Icahn spoke midday yesterday and after that time, NWL took off and finished up 10%. I realize there are hundreds of other companies he could be referring to, but I don't see any reason to rule this out. I know he tends to focus on industrials and doing massive auto roll-up. Maybe he's going after AAP. 

Any other companies that we should buy calls on?

They get $ for these drugs up front, milestone payments, and royalties on any actual sales. This way they don't have to develop these drugs, only discover them. 

Tons of partnerships with all of big pharma. Literally every single big pharma company has a partnership with them.

With that they keep all of the really good drugs, the ones they like, and develop them in-house. 

Their current cancer combo has double the treatment outcomes to Roche's current standard of care. 3 years vs 16 months. It is going to get approval in June. They got TONS of other shit in both phase 2 and phase 3. Hence the name, array, its an array of drugs. 

I got in at 7 and sold at 11. Then back in at 9. By dad got 1k shares at 6 and then 1k at 8. And you know something is good if my dad bought some, believe me. 

Cure cancer with me while making bank.

Only thing people around me use it for is to talk to underclassmen and tinder thots. 

For some reason anyone who's currently a sophomore or younger will ask for your snap instead of your number to talk. Occasionally people still use snapmaps, but its useless most of the time since most people are in ghost mode because letting people see your location 24/7 is fucking creepy. Every other function is on Instagram, and insta does it better too.

Last update is shit, totally fucked up the UI. Stories and messages are intertwined, so stories don't show in chronological order anymore. Also the update auto installed. People hate when things install themselves on their phone ('member U2's album?). Anyways go search on twitter and see for yourself, people fucking hate it.

Its been flying under the radar of many in this sector and I think its time people take a good look at them. They have a diverse portfolio with a rather rare share structure.

The Cannabis investment is focused solely in Quinsam Capital corp (QCA). The CEO of QCA sits on the board of VGN, and Anthony is on the board of QCA. VGN has acquired shares in the previous private placements. Here is a pretty recent write up outlining the breakdown of the investments https://equitygrades.com/2018/01/18/greencastle-resources-investments-paying-off/

The other major position VGN is currently involved with is Deveron (DVR) a super cool agriculture drone company. VGN has expressed interest in divesting part of this position and the speculation is that they will be using these proceeds to further invest in Cannabis companies. Here is a board presentation at Gravitas from last week with CEO of Deveron David Macmillan https://youtu.be/ASm6-bg-VAk?t=3m55s

The CEO has been vocal on twitter within the last month expressing that the stock is cheap, and that 2018 could be a very good year https://imgur.com/a/yxYii . He hints at gold assets being a secret sauce, along with WEED, and Drones. I believe there was a $500k royalty payment due by Dec 31st from one of the gold assets.

Current assets sitting at $3.81m as of last filing. https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsxv-vgn/greencastle-resources-shares/news/is-greencastle-resources-ltds-cvevgn-balance-sheet-a-threat-to-its-future/

The icing on the cake for this company is it has a very low float. Shareholders are locked and aligned with the 16 year track record of Anthony Roodenburg. The CEO also puts his money where his mouth is. VGN approved a buyback program and has been buying up shares over the last year as recently as 500k shares at the end of last month @ .13/share. (https://ceo.ca/vgn)

Shares outstanding: 41m

Retail float : ~21m

Share price: .13 (Feb 21 close)

Market Cap: $5.3m

These people are idiots and you shouldn’t listen to them. If they were good enough they wouldn’t be sharing their ideas. 

So here are my ideas take a good listen:

1. Don’t diversify: Diversifying stops you from making the most possible money. Go all in on every buy. That’s the best way to make money

2. Leveraged ETFs are the only stock to buy. If you want to gain make sure you get something that is really gonna go up. Why make 3000 when you can make 9000? Also buy SVXY. Trust me. Shit is going up for ever. 

3. Actually just trade futures and options. High risk/ high reward. Fuck that other weak shit. 

4. Buy on Margin. You only have to pay it back if you lose a bet. Just don’t lose and you don’t have to worry! 

5.  Don’t plan on when to sell. You might be tempted to set a Stop Loss 5-10% below your buy in. It’s better to just watch the market and sell as soon as the stock has a red day. Make sure you sell as soon as you feel a little anxious. Your emotions will never lie to you

It did, and I was able to sell a bunch before February came and wiped out the value of the remaining options (*As I've said before, options trading is extremely risky and buying out-of-the-money options even more so). [Total profit, ~$2,500,000](https://ibb.co/gk0bax).

Many of you know I was posting about $100k in SPX calls back in December and then January when the value started taking off. Figured I owed you an update.

Why I bought a crazy amount of SPX calls:
Congress passed a bill slashing corporate tax rates in December. The last time corporate taxes were reduced so much was back in 1986. So I looked at how the market reacted at the beginning of 1987 and saw a huge spike in the S&amp;P 500 in the first quarter.

I wanted to bet the market would react in a similar fashion. I looked through various strike prices in Jan-Mar and modeled which ones would have the highest payouts if Jan 2018 was a repeat of Jan 1987. I also ran a few more conservative scenarios and bought options at those inflection points as well. Many of these options were so far out of the money at the time they were selling for under a dollar. With volatility so low a melt up wasn’t being priced in at all so I put in every dollar I was comfortable losing.

January turned out to be the best first month of the year for the market in more than two decades. The value of the options skyrocketed, some by as much as 5000%. 

I was excited and terrified for the same reasons I bought options and not futures or heavily margined shares in the first place. Going back to 1987, there was eventually a large crash (Black Monday) that wiped out most of the gains for that year. I also knew we were currently going through one of the largest stretches of market history without a substantial pullback. I was pretty sure the market was going to go up and fast, but it was like a game of hot potato to lock in gains before a major correction happened. 

With that in mind I actively sold off chunks of the investment as it went up in January. Since I didn’t know if or when a correction would happen, I wanted to make sure I locked in as much profit as possible.

I was still holding the bag on a bunch of these options when Feb came and wiped them out, taking a large amount of paper gains with them. Another green week and I definitely would have been into yacht-money territory with this trade.

Still, I’d managed to sell enough in January to lock in two and a half million dollars from a $100k investment.

Aside from NVDA leaps I picked up last year and stocks I plan on holding indefinitely, I'm currently mostly in cash waiting to figure out the next move.",,80e7x2,,1,,false,1520598833,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/80e7x2/the_big_long_made_25_million_in_january_off_100k/,,,,,

From Apple to Fedex the role of robots is widening as companies seek to realise lower costs.  

Key to expanding this broadening range of industrial tasks is machine vision.  Cognex, a pioneer of machine vision since the 1980s, is a manufacturer of machine vision systems used to inspect and identify parts, detect defects, verify product assembly, and guide assembly robots.

It has seen huge growth with revenues and earnings more than doubling since 2013. 

Q3 was another fantastic quarter with revenues up 39% at $180 million.  The bottom line was a loss as the company invested heavily in R&amp;D and increasing its sales force for future growth but with adjustments net income increased 46% to $56million.

U.S. industrial production is trending upwards strongly and confidence is increasing which is all positive for spending by U.S. manufacturers on factory automation.

The total addressable market is huge with potential appliances in production lines from auto manufacturing to life sciences as well as logistics and even smart phones.

Priced on a multiple of 40 times current year estimates Cognex isnt cheap but, given its execution and outlook, it looks well worth it.

eBay was 13% of total payment volume for Q4 2017 and that percentage is falling every quarter. Additionally, PayPal is still a payment option on eBay, it’s just not going to be the default. 

On the call, they mentioned that literally nothing has changed since the split agreement was put into place years ago, and the reason they were comfortable with the split in the first place is because the current operating agreement restricted PayPal from partnering outside of eBay. Now they’re free to pursue other partnerships without restriction. 

Morgan Stanley just released a report a few weeks ago stating that PayPal was accepted at 87% of top online retailers, with the next highest being Amazon Pay at 11%. They’ve shown consistent ability to bring huge volume outside of eBay.

They just beat earnings, beat revenue, and posted guidance in line with expectations THAT INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE EBAY SPLIT. On top of that, they have a strong balance sheet, 7B cash and no debt.

note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple’s softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO’s stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO’s lighter guidance, with the company’s shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO’s share price is its indication of “recent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins”, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm’s BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

Here's where UAV stocks come into play. 
There's two critical events taking place right now that are extremely favorable to the industry. 1. An overall trend towards cost cutting in the resource sector, allowing traditional helicopter based geological surveys to be sidelined in favour of more cost effective UAV surveying. 2. Defense budgets are increasingly being allocated to the development and procurement of UAV surveillance and Reconnaissance equipment. 

Now those AMD hating cucks at Goldman predict this industry to be worth in excess of 100B by 2020, with emphasis on the role to be played via the military and government/commercial contracts.

Now I'm not trying to pump my holdings here but a Canadian company called Global UAV Technologies (C.UAV, YRLLF on OTC) is currently profitable at about 50% of total revenue in the 3rd quarter. This business is currently in talks with both the Canadian government's Global Affairs for a contract in addition to the U.S. DOD. The company operates multiple divisions, mainly focusing on geosurveying and the production of a heavy lift drone, the Procyon 800E. It is notable that UAV's drones operate on the ardupilot control system, rather than DJI's platform in the wake of DOD spying accusations. 

I strongly believe this company and the UAV sector as a whole will bring unmatched gains in the coming decade. A slightly longer play but worth the run imo.

There are a lot of chapters in this book so let’s start somewhere in the middle.

**Chapter 15**

*Technique of Selecting Preferred Stocks for Investment*

-This chapter seems to be about preferred stocks. We know that WSB’s preferred stocks are MU and AMD. But this book was written a few hundred years ago so they probably had different preferred stocks back then. Maybe GE?

-He starts talking about trains (railroads), I think this guy is autistic.

-My man Gram talks about cumulative vs. non-cumulative issues. Apparently, back in the day companies couldn’t miss dividend payments, and these were called *cumulative issues*. Then the companies realized that was dumb and started missing dividend payments, and that was called *non-cumulative issues*.

tl;dr - don't read chapter 15 of security analysis its dumb as fuck

Of course, he couldn't advertise it on facebook itself because it's filled with old people, but I'm sure he can think of something. Facebook could in turn monopolize the social media industry. Then when a new player comes in, it'll be like iphone vs android bullshit and everyone makes a lot of money.

Super simple: at the beginning of a pay period, take out a bunch of money on the card and put it in your broker of choice. (Note: make sure you have enough other cash lying around in case this doesnt work). Now if youve just invested in safe bets for that month, you probably have made some money on what was effectivly a negative interest loan (due to whatever meager cashback you get for using the card).

Now, when it comes time to pay the credit card bill, sell out your stock/stable etf, pay off the credit card bill, and repeat.

Additional notes:

1. DO NOT LET THE CARD ACCUMUATE INTEREST EVER. 

2. Make sure you have enough money lying around in case you have  a down month, and dont do this with risky investments.

Boom negative interest margin trading.

Thoughts?

Edit: Cash advances immediately accruing interest ruins this idea.

That is when i planned on reentering the market but i was smart enough to wait because this was clearly a trap. Now the market is simply reversing the ammount that went up on the first week of january. If you look at charts such as alibaba,nvda, amd, jd and many other stocks you can plainly see this fact. You guys who are overreacting are caught up in the hype instead of the reality. Unless you are trading options this pullback isnt a huge deal. Sure many of you lost alot of money but many are making this out to seem that its going to be 2008 all over again. Sure the market can truly crash but we havent lost 2 years of value only a correction of 1 or 2 months worth of value, at most 4. The only reason we experienced the worst point loss in 10 years is because things went so high, if it was the worst percentage loss wed have something to worry about.

This is probably intentional so they can inflate their market cap as high possible before they all get out and destroy their app altogether.

Snapchat loses money per user. Less users = less money lost = higher stock price.

The only way to make money on SNAP is to long.

Alternatively, we get millions of users to constantly send videos back and forth to each other 12-16 hours per day and watch the DailyMail story over and over, forcing them to lose more money. This would obviously need to be a large-scale operation and we can't do it between 3 of us faggots. But I don't have any confidence at all in organizing something of this scale so you'll probably all just lose money with your puts.

They've been beating earnings but failed with revenue because they anticipated a Hillary win so they had a huge supply ready to sell. Since she didn't win there was no fear of weapon bans so it dropped due to oversupply and no demand 

2. Now that the midterm elections are approaching there's going to be some fear plays again.

3. US military are preparing for a war with North Korea and Russia. Military is actually changing camo for prep.

4. School walkouts are being staged already for a gun control push. With Vegas and now this, seems like a matter of time before AR 15S are already hindered with serious restrictions to buy one 

5. Presidential nominees will start coming out at the end of the year or mid next year so if you want to get in at the lows it seems like right around now is the time.

I have $1,000,000 to invest in any securities (bonds, stocks, options, futures, etc) and in any regions for one month.
2. I can short selling and trade on margin.
3. I can potentially open more than one accounts.

The goal is to maximize the Shape ratio: http://www.stocktrak.com/pdf/ST_Sharpe_Ratio_3perc.pdf. The top 3 (out of around 80 students) would be the winners, so maybe I shouldn't use some strategy that is hyper risky.

This is my first class in finance and I have no prior knowledge about trading. Let me know if you need more information. I did some Google search and found https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16w9h3/just_started_the_stock_trak_program_in_my/ and http://education.howthemarketworks.com/news/easiest-way-to-win-a-virtual-trading-game/ helpful. But it seems that their goal is to maximize the return instead of the Shape ratio. And therefore the suggested strategy is to invest in hyper risky securities like 3xETF and futures.

Also, I'm wondering if the 3rd condition (creating more accounts) would introduce any arbitrage strategy? The cost to open a new account is less than the prize.",,7yh1x3,,0,,false,1520559748,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7yh1x3/i_kniw_this_might_not_be_the_best_place_to_ask/,,,,,

Seeing all these happy couples partaking in consumerism at it's finest masquerading as a day in which we all profess our love for each other brazenly.. I want to short Valentines day.

My strategy will be echo Bill Ackman's strategy with Herbal Life, but it will work, because I have something Ackman didn't have; Wall Street Bets. 

Here's the plan boys. We pour all of our money into Monsanto. Yes, you read it right. Monsanto.

Once we own enough shares of Monsanto, we take control of the board and fire everyone, effectively making ourselves the prime decision makers of the company. 

We then force Monsanto scientists and engineers to develop a GM crop (lets call it soy) that mimics estrogen and inhibits testosterone production. Next, we sell it to every food product company across the country as an emulsifier so that 90% of the packaged food in the country contains our soy product. 

The next stage unfolds on it's own. Boom. Frogs and other wildlife across the nation become androgynous. Men across the nation lose interest in women at alarming rates since they are essentially now androgynous soy boys. Due to dank levels of estrogen, women start becoming lesbians. In combination, we effectively witness the end of the era of heterosexual relationships. Due to some fluke, about 10% of the population will not respond to our soy products, so we will have to pacify them by creating a VR experience in which they can bed Taylor Swift every night in the oculus rift. 

And just like that, our puts on valentines day soar. Activist Investment at it's best. Bill Ackman will look like our little brother. George Soros will look like he just got done wiping off his titty milk moustache.

* Energy and Enviro. Solutions: 2% of sales. 

**Who are the customers?**

85% of Applied’s sales are from Asia. Just 10% of sales come from the US and Europe.

TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales.
Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. 
This means that their top 4 clients make up over 51% of sales.

**Numbers**

In 2015, Applied posted revenue of $9.66bn. In 2016 this number grew to $10.83bn. And last year the company reported revenue of $14.54bn, which grew at a rate of 34.6% YoY.

Total cash flow has grown more than 100% annually since 2014, and in AMAT’s conference call last quarter, CEO Gary Dickerson stated that he expects revenue to keep increasing at a 22% compounded rate through FY 2020.

With a PE ratio of 15.16 and an analyst mean price target of $68, I see no reason to buy in. This is one of the strongest companies I’ve seen in awhile, and the management is great about talking to shareholders.

One of AMAT’s closest competitors LRCX just reported last week and absolutely CRUSHED their estimates.

Earnings are Valentine’s Day AMC.

Though last week dragged this stock down, it has immense upside. AMAT hit $60 after its last very positive ER. If this week is green, I expect AMAT to lead the semi sector!

**This isn’t a great play for a swing trade as many of you may like. However, this is a GREAT long term play.**

Cenovus Energy (CVE):

&gt; Cenovus Energy is a Canadian Integrated E&amp;P
&gt; company with 281kboepd of production (lt/med oil
&gt; 11%, oil sands 50%, other heavy 13%, natural gas
&gt; 26%) and 230kbpd of refining capacity. Most of
&gt; the company's production is from oil sands
&gt; projects (all of which are SAGD - Cenovus has no
&gt; oil sands mining projects), but it also has sizeable
&gt; conventional oil and gas developments. Projects
&gt; are developed in phases with repeatable
&gt; concepts/designs.

As energy/oil stocks have been hit harder than most during the past few weeks, Cenovus has fallen nearly 30% based on no new information other than systemic issues with the sector.

As the price of oil has declined the past week and change (~10% drop), $55-60 per barrel of WTI is near the bottom of the economical scale that makes sense for oil sands projects. 

CVE though has a solvent-aided process (SAP) technology that allows it to be near break even as low as $45 per barrell, far below what other competitors would live at. This technology though is *just* starting to be put into place and will take several months for a full roll out, but should allow CVE to be among the lowest cost oil sand producers out there.

In December, CVE released its [2018 guidance](http://www.cenovus.com/news/news-releases/2017/12-14-2017-cenovus-s-2018-budget-continues-focus-on-deleveraging.pdf) citing several cost savings:

(2018 budget vs. Nov. 1, 2017 guidance)

Per-barrel oil sands operating costs – down 8%

Per-barrel Deep Basin operating costs – down 11%

Per-barrel oil sands sustaining capital costs – down 12%

Christina Lake phase G go-forward capital efficiencies – a 21% improvement (vs. previous estimate)

Total oil sands production – up 26%

Now a major negative is that CVE has taken significant focus in deleveraging their balance sheet. To do this, they've had to sell off assets. Obviously this will lead to lower net income, but it also means lower debt payments and capex reductions, leading to high equity value. 

On Friday, a worker died at their Christina Lake facility as a drilling rig was being moved. Though this may have had an impact on the stock, it's hard to attribute as the stock continued its slide in the mass energy selloff. 

After releasing it's 2018 guidance in December, CVE gained ~30% before giving it all back due to the systemic energy selloff. 

CVE trades at a FY P/E of 9.6x and a 0.8x FY P/B. It also pays a $0.20 dividend, making a current dividend yield of 2.6%.

CVE has beaten earnings expectations for four straights quarters.

The consensus price target (per MarketBeat) is $15.10, with PT of:

BofA Merrill Lynch: $12.50 

CFRA: $13

Morningstar:$16

Using the lowest PT ($12.50) would represent ~65% return from the current price.

Market is overreacting to a bribery investigation.,"Petrofac is an O&amp;G services company that has lost over 50% of its value in 2017 due to an ongoing investigation conducted by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. The investigation is part of a wider investigation into Unaoil, implicated in bribing government officials worldwide for a large number of oil companies including Rolls Royce, Haliburton, Honeywell, and KBR among others. 

Petrofac’s fundamentals are still healthy, and the market is mispricing the negative impact that the investigation will have on the company.

The company saw a large decline in order intake in 2016 due to lower oil prices which will translate into lower revenues until 2019 due to the lag time from order intake to revenue. However, this decline is still lower than the declines faced by the sector as a whole due to Petrofac’s focus on the MENA region where capex reductions have been less pronounced.
Combined with its focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement Petrofac’s fundamental business is in a better position than its peers and yet its trading at a significant discount to them.

The SFO investigation is highly unlikely to result in a fine larger than $400-$600M but the market is pricing in a total negative impact of up to $2B.

All alleged bribes occurred prior to 2011, when the UK Bribery Act went into effect, and therefore if the case goes to litigation Petrofac will be tried under the notoriously ineffective previous anti-bribery regime.

The company has continued to enjoy the same win rates on tenders it has historically had and had announced $5.8B in new orders so far for FY 2017, significantly higher than expected. Therefore, the investigation has clearly not affected its revenue generation capabilities.

Petrofac has a healthy liquidity position and banks have agreed to refinance large parts of its debt even after the investigation announcement.

There is further likelihood that the depressed current price will trigger a potential attempt at a hostile takeover by one of its competitors which will significantly increase the current price. Despite the fact that the CEO owns 18.2% of the shares, the fact that he appears to be implicated in the scandal will give a potential acquirer more negotiation power.

I therefore expect Petrofac to climb by approximately 50% by year end 2018. Earnings come out March 1 and that will likely be the catalyst that pushes it up.

This in and of itself is not a serious concern. But the manner in which it is happening should be something to pay attention to. [As the yield curve continues to flatten](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/does-a-flattening-yield-curve-mean-recession) the prospect of a 2019 Recession grows more and more.

**2) Increased Volatility**

The time of suppressed volatility is categorically over. I seriously doubt that we will ever see volatility fall below 12 for at least another 3-5 years. This low volatility environment has made many people complacent and as it continues to rise, the fear in the market will follow.

**3) Market Valuation**

[The current market P/E Ratio is at 32.10](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/), the highest it has been since December 1999. This is likely a result of massive overextension in popular tech names that have P/E Ratios of over 50 in this environment of irrational exuberance.

Another concern is the Market Valuation to GDP ratio. This is also known as the ""Buffett Ratio"". This ratio has NEVER been higher than it is right now and should be a serious concern in terms of valuations in this market. 

**4) Margin Debt**

I seriously believe that this is one of the greatest concerns in the market today. [The stock market is currently being propped up by $600 Billion of completely fake money in the form of margin debt.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2017/12/27/a-look-at-nyse-margin-debt-and-the-market)

**5) Warren Buffett Cash Balance**

This one is more anecdotal but I find it to be the most concerning. At the moment, [Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is sitting on a $109 Billion Cash pile](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/07/warren-buffetts-109-billion-cash-problem-how-much.aspx). I've got a really bad feeling that he is waiting for something awful to happen before scooping up cheap shares from weak hands.

I guess at 4:14 or 4:15 before the option expired SPY must've dipped below 266.50 because I woke up the next morning before the market opened and saw my balance was up about $140k. I thought it was a glitch with the Etrade app at first but then looked at my portfolio and saw what happened. For some reason I was assigned only 863 of the 1000 put contracts I sold. That's 86,300 shares of SPY which is about $23,000,000 worth. I only had $50,000 in my account so I started panicking and wondering if Etrade would liquidate my account or something, so I put in a limit order of 268 (SPY was trading around 268.12 at the time), hoping the sale would go through immediately. After putting in the order a message popped up saying my order would be put through when the market opened, which I don't understand because I thought you could buy and sell stocks/ETFs during premarket hours. So anyway I was stuck staring at my phone's screen until 9:30 when the market opened. Immediately about half my shares sold for $268 each. The market seemed to be dropping so I lowered my limit for the rest to 267.60 and the rest of them sold for that price. After all that my balance was about $112k higher than it was yesterday. Does anyone know how much interest Etrade will charge me for holding 23 million dollars of SPY for these few hours?

It does this with smaller fees often but they have failed to understand that even if their support reps are minimum wage their call times are routinely longer than 1 hr. This means not only are you causing your shareholders scaled liability due to criminally fraudulent business practices you arent even making actual money doing that and isnt what would indicate a viable business. Imagine you screw over several hundred thousand people on a broad basis. What are the odds that even one of those people, because almost everybody gets some type of internet or cable service, has the influence to cause the company problems in some way, bring a lawsuit, get the correct investigators attention, etc. What about if everybody who has ever been screwed over by comcast just decides to screw back in the ways they can? I would say, especially given the service % access in washington DC as though it were targeted that it is a high probability.

It is also worth noting regardless of your political stance that several of the properties (media) have drawn the ire of people in positions of power at this point across the isle. Could a company lose its license for telecom because of willful criminal behavior thats readily documented?

More than 30% of Americans cant afford even a one time incidental of $10. They are doing this type of stuff habitually as though they were an active threat against the American people.

Comcast broadly doesnt have a positive brand and thats thoroughly earned.

5g is coming online, bringing cable speeds to wireless drastically increasing the likely competition and ease of market entry in some respects.

So how can you profit from a companies systematic criminal negligence and years of bad business practices?

You can fairly easily take scaled bearish options positions if you [time your entries. Instead of paying the $5 and $10 criminally fraudulent charges you can invest that money.

This company could be worth more as a reverse merger but regardless the current price likely isnt reflective of its actual value.

It would also likely be worthwhile to ""raise awareness"" regarding current shareholders of the criminally negligent manner of its handling of their investment capital because I wouldnt want to be the last one out the door. Btw if I'm a company egregiously fraudulently billing customers for $5 and $10 charges every month when it costs hours of multiple support desks time who are paid more than that, how do you think I do my books? Quality of earnings, undoubtedly. Surprisingly criminally defrauding customers creating shareholder liability and class action liability at a minimum might be a bad idea.

It says ""Crash?"" with a time frame of sometime in 2018. So I've been sitting on the sidelines with cash. Am I right? probably not. Did I know it was going to happen? nope. Did this stop me from buying in the market? nope. Just made me more cautious.

This past week has had a pretty big drop. Around 7%. We haven't ""crashed"" just yet, but IF people continue to panic sell and some more bad shit news comes out like something to suggest instability in the US, then you have a good chance of continued momentum downward.

This is the chart continued

https://www.tradingview.com/x/x4DCVAMy/

In this chart, here you can see that it broke out of the upwards channel and as soon as it hit the upper IV line, it got rejected. Why it happened? I don't know. Just that in my experience from trading, I've always seen the prices bounce around these levels.

So the market is falling due to the economic policies due to quantitative easing ending.  People are in panic selling their shares and putting them into bonds.  Now in theory this makes sense since the risk free rate known as the 10 year treasury note has been going up.  However, there is something I believe is missing from some people`s thought process.  If you look at this link :https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y
If you click all it shows that since 1978 the rate has been falling.  I havent actually done the math but Im willing to bet that over that same time period if you took 1 share of any blue chip stock say microsoft and reinvested its divided and accounted for splits you would be far better off than bonds.  Yes, you can lose more with stocks however to me it seems stupid to say you should prefer bonds due to lower risk since to me it would suck to lose on a security with low risk than one with higher risk since when you have lower risk you expect to at least keep what you put in originally (cost basis).

Their revenue is down almost 40%, and their profit down almost 38% in that same time frame.  A few days ago they announced a $90M move into Asian markets; but that has nothing to do with the current price.

I mean, they're clearly a pyramid scheme... even in section 1A (Associated Risks) of their earnings report they literally say:

""To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of [..] our Members.""

Which is kind of a half truth; because they still haven't released membership information for 2017, or an annual report.  Gee, I wonder how closely recruitment ties into their 'direct sales strategy'.

Anyways, those dipshits that buy into Herbalife have me thinking.  If Lularoe, Amway, and all that other shit is all the rage on Facebook, people really don't seem to care about Herbalife any more.

I highly anticipate seeing 20 dollars plus on the 15th. MAYBE 25 before the end of the week.

Although unlikely it if does keep going up if short interest/volume is still there it could continue going up.

I see this happening because several places have pegged this stocks price point at 25 dollars or more combined with the very good news of earnings and that this is a larger company and not a pump of a garbage penny stock.

What if I told you they're dumping their positions real sneaky like? What if I told you we're not only blowing the everything bubble, but also some fat institutional dick? 

I have no evidence to support these claims, but if it does blow up I'm 100% going to say I told you so.

I don't believe this to be some great safe investment. If it was, it wouldn't be trading at a third of its NPV.

If they get found out for kankan being a hoax or whatever, their shares should trade down to $6 or so because of their sharecare.com stake and vegas.com ownership. 

If kankan really is as good as management is preaching, this will trade north of $20 though.

Stories and direct snaps from friends are all jumbled into one section.

As a result, it's a pain in the ass to scroll down and find people's stories. 

I still want to view other people's stories tho, mostly because I'm a nosy bastard and I like seeing who is fucking who and I like watching those embarrassing drunken videos before they get deleted at around 11am.

Tellingly, the stories I put up are still getting the same amount of views that they were before the update. It seems like most people are done complaining about the new update and have just accepted it. Even my 40-something-year-old work colleague who nearly cried about the new layout is back to sending snaps, uploading stories and viewing stories.

When you finish looking at a friend's story, an option pops up to view the next person's story. I always click on this option because I can't be arsed trying to scroll down and manually find it. 

Between stories, I am being shown advertisements. This didn't happen as much on the last version, as I was able to easily select whose story I wanted to view. 

**As a result, I am viewing WAY more of those ""transitional ads"" than I used to.**

------------

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

- The market is beholden to central banks due to years of QE 

- The Stock/Bond return correlation is important to watch

- Diversification between stocks and bonds only works when this correlation is negative.

- If bonds selloff too quickly, the return correlation can flip positive.

- When this happens equities selloff along side bonds.

- Friday's jobs report showed higher than expected signs of inflation.

- If inflation spikes, the Fed will tighten monetary policy faster than previously expected.

- In anticipation of such a move, the market fell.

----

&amp;nbsp;

Now the entire “Goldilocks” environment that we have in the current economic climate hinges upon central banks (namely the US Federal Reserve) normalizing policy slowly and carefully. Why? [Because central banks have injected nearly $20 trillion dollars into global financial markets since 2009 and such a rising tide has lifted all boats. What happens when global QE is done and we start to see QT? We don't know because its never occurred on this scale before. Also worth mentioning is that the Fed will be the first to pull out later this year. [(You can read more about that here:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-28/federal-reserve-ponders-how-to-do-the-big-unwind-quicktake-q-a). 

- [Or see this fun chart of it](https://imgur.com/epFmlvl)

- [Another great chart showing QE suppressing risk premia in fixed income, forcing investors into riskier assets](https://imgur.com/yXtx68Y)

But don't just take my word for it, here's an exerpt from a BofAML note:

- ""In 2017, multi-asset portfolios continued to benefit from equity/bond diversification. Low equity/bond correlation alongside record low cross-asset volatility is driving the vol of equity/bond risk parity portfolios to its lowest levels since the 1960s. Other multi-asset portfolios holding a mixture of equities and bonds have likely also seen extremely low volatility recently. However, a disorderly rise in yields that accompanies an equity market pullback (i.e., 2013 Taper Tantrum) could be a surprise for many investors who have become conditioned to the recent environment in which bonds and equities diversify one another.

- [**CHART**](https://imgur.com/6qgkzVO). 

- ""**The correlation of rate-sensitive assets to US rates is at record highs** as investors fail to care about outside risks, leaving markets increasingly dependent on US policy. Coupled with rates vol near lifetime-lows - on few expectations for policy disruption - this has helped suppress global cross-asset vol. However, **with the Fed appearing to soldier-on towards policy normalization, persistently low rates vol may be at risk. [This in turn creates risks for a market slaved to rates](https://imgur.com/wk3TnYR).""**

The Fed began tightening 2 years ago but very slowly. As long as inflation remains subdued then they can’t yank away the punch bowl too quickly. But,on Friday morning we had a jobs report that had very positive average hourly earnings gains leading to worries about a marked uptick in wage pressures. Wage pressures are one of the key areas that we have not seen inflation in years. If inflation spikes unexpectedly and the Fed is caught with its pants down behind the curve, they will be forced to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace. This is a negative for risk assets.

&amp;nbsp;

**The other piece of the puzzle is the bond market.** 

Stocks and bonds tend to move inversely to one another as the former is riskier than the later. If you're a diversified investor with both stocks and bonds, you're doing that because if one market suffers the other ought to soften the blow to your portfolio. In a general sense think of bonds as safe investments and stocks as risky. There is a lot more to it but thats the general idea. When investors are bullish on the future and ""risk-on"" is alive, you would expect to see flows out of bonds and into stocks. (Like we did immediately post-2016 election). 

So starting with [this chart from goldman](https://imgur.com/HFuPJdp), (which is almost a year old but serves to illustrate my point), you can see how stocks and bonds tend to behave relative to one another over time. 

- The top left quadrant shows how a diversified 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio has performed over the long term. This is showing us in the dark blue spikes above the 0-line that such a portfolio has performed very well, better than the long term average (which is the horizontal light blue line). 

- Next look at the bottom right quadrant, which shows us the equity/bond return correlation shaded in dark blue. Now as you can see, aside from a few short instances, the correlation between equity and bond returns has been negative since 2000. [This means that since 2000 bonds have almost always rallied when equities have sold off.](https://imgur.com/rGZ9pJ7).Thus, diversified investors have been sheltered from losses as their bond holdings were intended to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

However when that return correlation flips positive, as it has many times in history, the two asset classes may sell off together and such a diversified portfolio may not help staunch the bleeding.

Now as bond prices and yields more inversely, most people will reference the US 10-yr Treasury bond yield as a benchmark or a thermometer of sorts. Rising bond yields can be a good thing, as it means investors are selling bonds and (hopefully) moving into equities or riskier investments. BUT, there a point at which a bond market selloff moves too quickly, yields spike faster than expected, and investors interpret that as a panic signal.


---


Now this week we saw bonds sell off dramatically, causing yields to spike above the comfort levels of many investors. This combined with the jobs report (and likely the political theater of today) spooked the market. Will it continue? Your guess is as good as mine but I think that ""BTFD"" will be muted next week due to the fervor of last week's volatility spike inverting the VIX curve.

2. Patriots (-5) or Eagles (+5)?

Here are mine... 

1. The market continues to pullback this week and dips down to the -10% territory, but rebounds and continues on its bull run for a few more months until interest rates are hiked and the economy slows - at which point we will enter an official bear market running into 2019 and the suicide rate among WSBers increases by 700%. 

2. Patriots will beat the Eagles by at least 5 points (probably by a lot more). Tom Brady is awarded Super Bowl MVP, retires at the end of the game, goes home to bang his wife that kind of looks like a dude, decides to begin a career in gay porn and focuses on a special niche of blowing gay porn stars dressed up as referees. Bill Belichick realizes he is nothing without Brady and retires from coaching only to open up a clothing line that sells cut-off sleeve hoodies - calls the brand Belichic. Belichic goes public and becomes the next meme stock for WSB and launches the market into the next bull run of 2019. Everyone in WSB gets rich and buys yachts.

XSP is a market ETF that tracks the SPY pretty closely. It pays a 1.4% dividend and is relatively cheap. 

At the current price of rejection  @ 32.00 ish a full on crash, you might expect things to tank to around 50%. Plan for 60% to be safe. So reasonably, an expectation of a 13.00 to 16.00 range

This gives you around 5 to 6 different entries. @50% 

If you're starting at 27.50 with $5100 in the bank

 To maximize your entries, you should be increasing your entries by 50% of the previous. This will bring you about one IV deviation from the bottom in the event of a reversal.

27.50 - $242 - 9 shares
24.50 - $363 - 14 shares
22.25 - $545 - 24 shares
20.00 - $816 - 40  -shares
17.65  - $1225- 69 shares
14.50 - $1837 - 126 shares

Average share price  $17.82 less w.e you collect in dividends.

If you're starting like me and making bad trades , then you've probably taken an entry  at 30 - approx. 6% drop.

If the market continues sideways or upwards, you're going to want to get time in the market as well. So a good plan is to divided the amount you have over the number of weeks it takes you to save that same amount.  So if it takes you 1 year to save $5000, you're looking at putting around $100 in the market every week (trying to continue buying the same amount of shares every week). This will put you at an expected return  of 6 to 7% + dividends.

The current pattern on the chart of the god-damn 10 YR over the last 4 days is still inside the large drop we saw on the 5th, which tells us that the god-damn 10 YR is not out of the woods, but can in fact retest those lows.

Trading -15% of its recent highs, the Shanghai Composite has broken through its 1 Yr and 2 Yr moving averages and is looking to close above its 4 Yr moving. 

[Figure 1. Technical Supports For The Shanghai Composite](https://imgur.com/a/Gvbww)

I believe the 4 Yr moving average to be a strong support level. The 4 Yr moving average held after the 2015 Chinese Stock Market Bubble collapsed around in early 2016 and therefore I believe it will work now. Also with the Chinese New Years is coming up and investors may want to lock in gains before the week long holidays. Back in 2016, Chinese markets faced something similar.

+1 Jan 19 FEYE call $15

+1 Apr 18 SNAP put $19 

+ Apr 18 SPY put $262

+10 XIV @ $109 (bought at discount.......

**what I’m doing tomorrow**


I will open or close positions based on what the market does specifically tomorrow. Whether it’s up Down or sideways to shit I am doing something.


**market down, VIX up** 


This is what I need. VIX up and SPY up so I can close it up at a massive gain and go look for some dumb shit to write cash secured puts on like $amd because IV is inflated, then cash in once VIX is $29 again.


**market up, VIX down**


This is unfortunately my bad scenario. I’m hoping speigels malnourished baby (snap) has some profit taking occur so I can take a gain to offset my inevitable SPY loss.


**market sideways then Cramer calls out WSB and r/personalfinance mods can’t keep up with 401k exit posts**


This is where I probably will close up at least one SPY put and maybe my RIOT put if I can time the market. I don’t want to be assigned riot shares, and I don’t want to risk $1000 or so on a SPY bet. I can’t hedge against my SPY puts because I am so poor I cant write a cash secured put on it at a lower strike. What’s this margin that everyone’s talking about?

What’re you doing?

I didn't want to play with my money, I wanted to be safe and show I'm a adult with responsibility.

Everyone told me to go for ETFs. You'll make 4% a year, no risk, you will never beat that.

So in January I bought Vanguard all-world ETFs. Only 2 weeks later and I'm down almost 10%. WTF?!

Then I realized: they don't know shit. The only reason everyone recommends a ETF is because it worked for the past couple of years.

But why use the past to predict the future when you can use the future to predict the past?!!!???!!!

So if I sell my Vanguard ETFs right now, take the loss and buy something else, how fast can I be up 1000%. Please only real answers!

Be bored no more!  Now you can bet on the volatility of the volatility of the stock market with VIX^2 today!  

Imagine you are driving around in your Jaguar F-type R and you see a 55 mph speed limit sign.  You come to a dead stop and stomp on the gas.  A cop comes and pulls you over and tells you that you were traveling at a high rate of speed.  You smile and say to that jackass that there is no such thing as a rate of speed limit and that you simply accelerated to 55 mph.  You go on further to explain that speed is the rate of distance over time, and that acceleration is the rate of speed over time.  The cop nods and gives you his girlfriend as a trophy for your superior intellect.

Trading in VIX^2 is just like that.  Why cruise at 55 mph worried about the next speed trap when you can zoom up to that speed in a matter of a few seconds, skid out of control and zoom back up again?  

I am also offering XIV^2 for those who are prone to fatal deceleration events.  Imagine if Paul Walker had a few shares of this, just WOW!

I was getting a laughable return on a super ultra conservative portfolio through an investment firm, so I pulled that shit and decided I'd do the right thing - and try to make more.  
  
I don't know where to put my cash though. Knowing that what we're witnessing is really just a bunch of panic and doomsaying rather than a turn in the economy - I'm considering buying into some big dip on a company like Google (maybe Alibaba), but I'm also torn between investing into a fund that inverses the VIX. It's riding at bottom levels right now, since a few days ago obviously, and I doubt this unsurity is going to last forever - so I'm thinking my money may be best put there for when the dust settles, and then it can fly up again, but I'm admittedly inexperienced with how quickly the VIX can settle back down. It was riding super low for a long time, are we going to go back there again?

Looking at you elon....when we did encounter problems it was on the way down....we did stop as we sent a submarine towards the ocean floor..but cmon they don't serve tendies down there and your mom can't hear our shouts for more.....our existence is based on pushing ourselves higher and higher(looking at you Canada with all that legalization). There are very few instances where we desire something going down.....and most of those involve her going down on you bc why the hell should you go down on her after taking her to a nice 3 piece tendie dinner. And even during that moment of going down we cannot resist the urge to shoot higher, up through the roof of her mouth after hitting peak bottom. We have a built in floor in everything we do. So to all you bears out there, remember that the polar ice caps are melting and there are fewer places for you to run as we continually aim higher and higher...who knows how far us Bulls are willing to go...our supreme leader Shkreli fought the good fight. He will rise once again, like we all do after a night of getting rimmed by a Bear's sister. And in this struggle, we turn to the greeks....whose guiding hands reward those who go Kim Long VIX and not those who have short dicks....in the end, we all want to go up and the path of least resistence always wins....it just so happens that most of the times it involves a Bear getting betrayed by one of their own...Lord Mark Cuckerberg...

Tldr: Bulls fuck Bears' moms, sisters, wives, gfs

Arista Networks is a classic disruptor that has almost everything going right for it these days. Arista's cloud-based networking technology beats traditional hardware in both speed and capacity, and the world's increasing appetite for data helped the company increase revenue more than tenfold over the past six years. Arista's third-quarter report was more of the same: Sales grew more than 50% and net income more than doubled. Fourth-quarter results come out in two weeks, and management has guided for continued growth, with the top line expected to increase about 40% over last year. And about Arista's leadership: It's top-notch. Co-founder and chairman Andy Bechtolsheim is a Silicon Valley legend, founding Sun Microsystems and funding Google in its infancy. CEO Jayshree Ullal and co-founder and chief technology officer Kenneth Duda are superstars in their own right. What's more, Bechtolsheim and Ullal control about 23% of shares between them. Plug in for a long run with this innovator.

Arista Networks' fourth-quarter results continued its impressive run of growth. Revenue jumped 43% to $467.9 million, and that was slightly higher than the consensus forecast among investors for $463 million in sales. Adjusted net income soared 77% to $137.3 million, and the resulting adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share topped the $1.42 per share that most of those following the stock had expected to see.
Sales gains were well balanced across Arista's segments, with product sales jumping 41% even as the smaller but still important services division experienced stronger growth of more than 55%. Internal efficiency remained strong, with gross margin rising another 1.5 percentage points to 65.9%.

As we've seen before, Arista kept a tight rein on most of its expenses. Research and development costs jumped by half, but a decline in overhead expenses and just slight increases in sales and marketing costs helped keep operating expenses in line. That in turn helped to boost Arista's earnings by a greater percentage than its revenue gains.

CEO Jayshree Ullal was very happy with the way that the year ended. ""2017 represents a market tipping point,"" Ullal said, ""with Arista's disruptive software-driven architecture gaining mainstream acceptance as we surpassed 15 million cumulative ports of cloud networking."" CFO Ita Brennan pointed to 2017's 46% revenue jump and 70% rise in adjusted earnings per share as further marks of success for the year.

**Arista CAN keep growing:**

Arista's future remains bright. One reason why Arista had such a strong year was that business from key customer Microsoft grew even faster than the company had expected. Microsoft made up about 16% of Arista's business, and Ullal pointed both to Microsoft's own success with Azure and to Arista's Microsoft engineering team in developing use cases that appealed to users of the systems. Such collaborations with what the CEO called ""cloud titans"" will be a top priority in driving Arista's future growth.

2018 promises to be an interesting year for Arista. The company expects to enter into the 400 gigabit Ethernet market space in the coming year, and after having reached the status of market share leader in the 100 gigabit Ethernet switching industry, Arista can expect to lever its reputation among purchasers to work more closely with service providers, cloud specialty providers, and enterprise customers more broadly.

Arista's first-quarter guidance was generally in line with what investors had foreseen. A range of $450 million to $468 million in revenue was in line with the consensus forecast for $458 million, and guidance for adjusted gross margin of 63% to 65% and operating margin of 32% was generally consistent with past quarters.

Yet shareholders wanted more from Arista, perhaps through stronger projections for 2018 or further signs of accelerating growth in key product areas. In response to that disappointment, the stock dropped 13% in pre-market trading Friday following the Thursday afternoon announcement. In the long run, though, Arista Networks seems to be doing everything it can to capture a growing piece of the important networking space. Long-term investors might well see any pullback for the stock as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern.

**Why I’m still VERY bullish on Arista:**

It shouldn't be surprising that growth will moderate as Arista builds from its larger base. Of course, investors should also keep in mind that Arista has made a habit of underpromising and overdelivering, so I won't be surprised if this outlook proves conservative when 2018 is said and done. But it also didn't help that Arista Networks' stock price had more than tripled over the past year leading up to this report, likely tempting some skittish investors to take profits despite the continued relative strength of Arista's underlying business.

This was another strong report from Arista Networks, and contrary to what Friday's decline might indicate, long-term investors should be more than pleased with their position.

Disclosure: I am now long with roughly $3700 in Arista. Looking for exit at $305. Will add 50% more to position if drops to $238.75

Wanted to share with you faggots.

MU has been trading sideways since December 2017 with a good support level around 39. You fags keep trying to buy calls and keep losing money. Now, I am expecting that it will go to 50 before or after earnings but looking at the probability calculator, it is unlikely. I wouldn't mind buying MU around 38-39 price range since it has good support but right now at 43.50 its too risky for me to buy.

The solution is to sell an April 20 38 PUT for credit 1.20 while at the same time open a vertical call spread with same expiry. Total is as follows

Sell April 20 38 put for credit of 1.32

Buy April 20 45 call for debit of 2.70

Sell April 20 50 call for credit of 1.23

In this case, the total debit I paid was 2.7 - (1.32 + 1.23) = .15

The P/L looks like this:

https://i.imgur.com/Dprt8Fm.png

From the P/L you can see 3 things:

The probability of being assigned is ~~0~~ 25%.
If I don't get assigned the most I can lose is .15.
If I am right, the profit is 5.
Anyway, I think this is a good strategy for stock you want to buy at a discount anyway and aren't afraid to be assigned.

Now go make money with MU. ",,7xvk96,,0,,false,1520544743,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7xvk96/im_going_to_tech_you_how_to_actually_make_money/,,,,,

I'm long a good amount of ES and I don't want to sell (still bullish for the next couple of months). I'm feeling sort of like a puss, so debating buying some puts or putting on a collar.  I also don't want to take a big hit going into the weekend if I can help it, this has been a great week. Non-trading days suck, even more after a loss, and this is a long weekend too.

Overall my plan is to add on dips if I can find my balls again. I missed the choo choo train at 2690 this morning because I was looking at CL. Shorting that now as a sort of semi-hedge but it's only a fraction of my ES position.

How does the execution work when there are multi legs?  It seems if I split the bid and ask for both legs, it would fill them at different times, or possibly one leg and not the other.  Although my gut tells me that's not likely.  Especially when traders have 3 or maybe even 4 legs.

The movement is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of online finance articles,  most of the money will fly right out of a typical investor's wallet. There’s also Su Bae's opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The real investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate Zen based cpus, to realize that they’re not just looking at your typical indicators on a real time basis- they find something deep about the bag holding that is compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via going long.

As a consequence, autists who dislike AMD truly ARE faggots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Su Bae's existential catchphrase “RYZEN™ POWERS. RADEON™ REIGNS. YOU PREVAIL.” which itself is an ironic reference to Adam Smith's ""The Wealth of Nations"". I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated speculative traders providing candid feedback in earnest as AMD’s stock collapses on itself on their Robinhood screens.

I feel like there is less risk speculating on a bearish etf and  holding overnight,etc due to all the volatility going on whether its indictments, interest rates/yields, inflation, etc

sure you could lose some money as it steadily increases upwards whether it being .5%-1.5% upwards but i can't see a drastic 5-10+% upside move overnight or intraday.

What if you remove ethics out of it?","Orrrrr is it because you weren't in it from the start? 

Jokes aside, I watched a documentary yesterday on Netflix about shorting Herbalife (which makes me qualified to talk about it). I agree with the main jew about how evil the company is, but I always thought about what I would do if given the opportunity to legally invest in a ponzi scheme. I mean, it's a money fucking printing machine, right?

But what if you threw that whole concept out of the window? Fuck a tricky, scummy company that sells shit products to poor fags. What if you make a ""fair"" ponzi scheme? A scheme where everything is fair and secured by a system/algorithm? Can this be done? A transparent pyramid scheme where everyone is in on it?

I've been thinking about this and haven't found a similar project. Anyone have any thoughts? Would it work?

Now if you aren't already thinking what I'm thinking, the plan is next.

We *somehow* ( we might need a man from the inside ) figure out the day the dividends are paid out. 

And the day **before** they are paid out **WE PUMP THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF IT**. What will happen next day is we get guaranteed 30% gains on whatever the pumped stock is worth at.

Investor#1: I'm no expert, but if my intuition is right, there's going to be a market crash, probably tech. That's why I've been afraid to invest in Vanguard since 2015. I'm just waiting for it to pass. Idk i might be totally wrong.

Investor#2: Primary thing I'm gathering from that article is sales haven't increased to match the surge in the stock market. If sales keep going down, the market will downturn. So it seems the market increased on speculation that profit margins would improve but they have been lagging and if sales don't improve, the market will head toward a decline. Whoever got the benefit of Trump's presidency better get out there and start buying with their tax breaks and wage increases. I would myself, but I haven't yet gotten a raise, bonus, or tax break. I've got food to buy and bills to pay. If that ain't enough to keep the market afloat, the more fortunate will have to pick up the slack and buy my share of unnecessary bullshit. (OP: I read the article, it didn't say anything about sales.)

Investor#3: The GDP numbers and more importantly wage gains looked surprisingly strong! The economy is getting better. This reduction is irrelevant in the larger picture of an improving economy that is lifting people off of food stamps and giving workers better wages. Investors are worried interest rates will go up because people are getting fatter paychecks and thus companies will have to shell out more of their profits to workers. This is actually good news, not bad. The stock market drop is actually a positive in this case.

Investor#4: Decided to start investing out of an IRA I opened in October. Three months in and I thought it was so easy. People are stupid for not doing this. Just put most of your money in ETFs! BOTZ was making a killing for me. Then this week wiped out almost all of my gains to date.

Investor#5: The dow is basically a bunch of stocks put together. Basically if its high that means people are putting their money down making informed bets about the future price of the stocks. But the stocks are more or less tied to the overall economy.

Investor#6: It's one of the indicators of the US economy. Considering half the US population has investments in the stock market (most through 401k), it's kind of a big deal.

Investor#7: Stock markets are in a bubble. Have you heard of tulip mania and beanie babies? Stocks are essentially the same thing! Edit: It's all a Ponzi scheme! Wake up, sheeple!

Genius#8: Well, I like to trade in (insert banned word)-currency. I laugh in the general direction of your 2.5% market drop. Ha ha!

Some guy on SSI#9: Jesus man. I’ve lived in this country my whole life and I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to not know what that means.

1517692365,wallstreetbets,HinduHamma,self.wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7v24vy/serious_dip_buying_discussion_thread/,61,61,,,Serious dip buying discussion thread,"Ok this week was a fucking blood bath and I'm not trying to catch a knife with the rest of my cash that I have on the sidelines - no point in degenerate gambling on calls (maybe puts though lol) right now since almost every single close this week was a fucking plunge into weakness with stupid amounts of selling instead of a strong close with buying volume. 

that means big money was not interested in buying the fucking dip...and right now, judging by the news and market sentiment, I don't see a reason they will BTFD next week either (I can see a deadcat bounce on tuesday which could be a good put buying opportunity thou if monday is another 1% plunge - watch the futures when they open back up tomorrow, could be a key sign as they were on the spot last week)

So, I think its just smart to wait out the storm which could be a week .. could be a month..either way its still a bull market and this will reverse as its always done in the past...just watch for strong buying volume and watch the daily/weekly charts and see when we have hit a floor...then wait for confirmation and uptrend signals...thats when it will be safest to enter back imo...bond/yields need to stabilize as well so keep an eye on that.

Theres going to be a serious BTFD opportunity that could be a game changer for everyones portfolios... so lets try to discuss somethings on buying calls? (shares work, but dude, get options enabled, seriously)

1) what kind of expiry y'all thinking about?

I'm thinking for shorter dated leaps (jan 2019)..anyone confident on quarterlies/monthlies? I don't like whats brewing for march/april with the fed meeting but it looks like the market is pricing it in now....also treasuries yield has not stopped gaining which makes me think we need to play it safer and wait for it to find a top and hope it settles..



2) wtf do i buy though?

slow and steady movers are the way to go imo..Visa, MSFT, JPM/BAC....non meme shit that won't get fucking dicked on by bullshit news/analyst/volatile markets like MU/AMD....I think these slightly OTM calls on those type of companies (or the indices) are solid bets like a $105 strike jan 19 MSFT ...not to expensive either...financial sector should remain great as people are spending money since they are making money..more loans..better interest rates..economy is stable for the most part..lot of positives in financials imo..anyone got some different opinions? maybe something in health care since they got a little extra beat down with the JPM/buffet/bezos threesome? or fuck it and go with meme shit anyways lol? AMD might actually have momentum this year
