Did I just secretly find the next meme stock?

*SendGrid's business is sending out emails on behalf of some very large clients, including eBay (EBAY), the most prolific sender of emails in the world, and Uber and others, a total of 63,000 customers in all. The company sent 132 billion emails on behalf of its customers last quarter, to just under half the world’s email population.*

Personally, I am up biggly and it is one of my biggest holdings and I expect life-changing returns.  Here's the proof:https://imgur.com/a/XtAFH

I also first heard about the company when trying to find a real email provider beside MailChimp or ConstantContact at a place that made the mistake of hiring me to work in their IT dept.  They blow the doors off of $ADBE and $JCOM for this shit because you don't have to pay for a massive platform.

But WTF do I know, if I was so fucking smart I would have my own hedge fund and running OPM...and buying obscure biotechs...and raising the price of rare life-saving drugs...

Cheddar reported that Snap is working on 2 new versions of Spectacles! TWO. Wooo--NO. FUCK YOU. Okay, I get it. No one cares they lost $40 million. BUT They had over 170 million users and only 150,000 Spectacles were sold. I'm not an Asian math wizard but that's ^^calculating... not a lot. NO ONE FUCKING WANTS THIS FUCKING THING.

Spectacles 2.0 is rumored to be released this fall and 3.0 next year.

The first one didn't do shit because it had a terrible fucked up launch. A month of vending machines, then another 4 months for it to sell online, then another 4 for it to reach Europe. IT TOOK FOUR FUCKING MONTHS FOR A FUCKING COMPANY THAT DOES EVERYTHING VIA THE INTERNET TO SELL THEIR ONLY PIECE OF HARDWARE ONLINE!

Okay so this time maybe they'll just release it when it's available everywhere and their online store is ready. Then more people will buy it right?

But what about the SHITTY FUCKING HARDWARE? Not even 1080p, slow as fuck transfer rate, can't export without it turning into a fucking video polka dot, it's literally worse than just USING YOUR FUCKING HANDS TO SHOOT SOMETHING compared to aiming with your FUCKING FACE.

*But metaphor_for_micro_penis, they changed leadership. All of this will be addressed and a new era of glass wearing fuccbois and thots will begin.*

Oh you're talking about Steve Horowitz being replaced as VP of Engineering by Mark Randall? Steve who had previously worked at Motorola? Being replaced by Mark who... FUCKING WORKED AT MOTOROLA?! WHO ALSO WORKED AT GOOGLE WHERE THEY HAD THAT FUCKING GARBAGE GOOGLE GLASS?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THEY'RE BASICALLY CUM SWAPPING AND EXPECTING SOMEONE TO MIRACULOUSLY SWALLOW PINA COLADA

THIS UNCONFIRMED REPORT BY CHEDDAR BUMPS THIS DEFORMED RAPE CHILD OF A TECH COMPANY TO $18?

THIS FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT APP THAT GOT FUCKING ELBOW DROPPED BY INSTAGRAM STORIES, A FEATURE RELEASED 5 YEARS AFTER THEM?

WHY WONT THIS ASSHOLE EVAN SPIEGEL JUST KEEP SELLING HIS SHARES. WHY!

WHY CANT I MAKE MONEY!

Roku was up 320% from its IPO price before dropping 34% from its 52wk high after crappy Q4 earnings. 

- ROKU is currently the leading OS for TV streaming, but has major competition from FireTV, AppleTV, AndroidTV. Simply put: the latter got mo' money. 
- They've been able to monetize by: advertising, subscriptions through ROKU, brand buttons on their remotes, etc. Growth is expected to grow from 29% to 32% guidance in 2018
- Past Performance: Annual ARPU growth by 48% and platform revenue by 138% over the past year.

Now the big one...lockup expiry

- Roku's 180 day IPO lockup is set to expire end of March 27th
- about 20 million shares outstanding, $14 IPO....current price ~$36. the concern is insiders wanting to sell to lock in gains and consequently tanking the price.

First: Take a look at their website's performance in the areas we are comparing (q4 2016 vs q4 2017): https://i.imgur.com/M34HXL4.png . Notice anything? Traffic to their website has PLUNGED. Their website rankings have dropped from above 800 to just above 2000.

Meanwhile, lets take a look at their STOCK PRICE in the past year. https://i.imgur.com/JzojFwa.png . The stock price has increased almost 3x?

WHY? Because OSTK announced late last year that they were big into.... B L O C K C H A I N. However, their blockchain thing tzero is way behind schedule and they are doing the gay thing where they are trying to do everything ""by the book"" and this wont work because people trading crypto do not give a shit and just want to trade all their money right away. 

TLDR: OSTK announced that they were into B L O C K C H A I N and their price spiked despite having their actual e-commerce business get absolutely raped by amazon and plunging in traffic. They report earnings today and will have to admit this.

Actually doubled down on this trade right before close, now hold 20 put shares

4:02pm - here we go boys about to rub one out before it comes

4:11pm - Miss earnings and missed revenue significantly, stock down 5-6% aftermarket looking good so far

4:20pm - Ostk down 10% aftermarkets HAHHAHAHAHAH fuckers

4:33pm - CEO begins earnings call by giving a story about his rabbi HAHAHHAHAHAHA

this conference call is a mess. First a random listener somehow gets off mute and breaks into the call, then later a server error happens and the CEO has to ask operator to see what powerpoint slide they are on. Operator says that she cannot see the slides. fucking ayy lmao

7:59pm - Last aftermarket trade puts overstock down 13.9% E Z M O N E Y

Resolution:

- Total cost of my puts was 4.75 x 20 x100 = $9,500
- Sold 10 puts at 9.5 and then the other 10 puts at 7.3, for a total of $16,800

The problem is they spent a ton on this purchase, which means they took on a lot of debt and need to pay it back which is going to dig into their dividends.

(This reminds me a lot of [TEVA and their massive acquisition of Allergan Generics for $40.5 Billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7jkncu/12000_teva_bet_and_some_dd/) that added a lot of debt to their income statement).

Since most of you are too retarded to generate an original thought I'll get you up to date on a nice YOLO with a company I've never seen anybody talk about in this sub (and for good reason): Newell Brands. 

Lets take a quick look at what Newell actually does.  Possibly the most boring company I've ever looked into, Newell is a marketer of consumer and commercial brands.  Under Newell's various business units you can find brands like: Rubbermaid, Rawlings, Marmot, Coleman, Sharpie, Elmers, Calphalon, Graco, and the list goes on.  Much like the backside of my nuts, these are brands your mothers are very familiar with. However, we don't give a fuck about any of these fundamentals and I've already gone into too much detail to be honest.  What we are looking to profit off of is the vote coming up at their 2018 Shareholders meeting that will decide who gets control of the board - which will in turn decide the direction of the company.

This all started when Michael Polk (the current CEO) decided to [aquire Jarden](http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Newell-Brands-Announces-Completion-of-Newell-Rubbermaid-and-Jarden-Corporation-Combination/default.aspx) back in 2016. Only reason this is important is because it is the Jarden Chairman and CEO, Martin Franklin, that accuses Michael Polk of mismanaging the brands.  A year after this acquisition investors were expecting big results, but Newell delivered just the opposite.  After a series of downgrades blamed on ""resin supply issues"" from Hurricane Harvey Newell release a shit earnings, [which i profited nicely on via puts](https://imgur.com/a/A8Gct).  

Now I'm not sure what Michael Polk was smoking when he hatched this plan, but in a complete reversal from the growth plan that had been laid out in prior years, Newell announced they were planning [to sell off nearly half their brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/25/newell-brands-stock-craters-20-percent-unveils-plans-to-sell-off-assets.html).  Fed up with this Franklin, along with two of his colleagues, stepped down from the board.

WSJ Link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-newell-brands-a-fight-over-the-board-and-strategy-1517394600

Broke Boy Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/martin-franklin-who-sold-his-company-to-newell-is-now-waging-a-battle-against-the-newell-board.html

Upon stepping down, Franklin was and still is a large shareholder of Newell and he teamed up with Starboard Value, an activist investing firm, along with other former Jarden execs to sieze control of the board.  They published a [letter](http://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_NWL_CEO_and_Board_02.12.2018.pdf) that, in summary, says Polk doesn't know what the fuck he is doing and also listed their candidates for board elections at the upcoming shareholder conference.  Newell then [clapped back](http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Newell-Brands-Independent-Directors-Issue-Open-Letter-to-Shareholders/default.aspx) with a letter of their own stating that Franklin is out his god damn mind and that they are fully committed to divesting large portions of the business.  To really spice things up, Carl Ichan has recently [taken a ""large position""](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/icahn-reveals-newell-brands-stake-as-starboard-pushes-for-change) in Newell but claims to be undecided on which camp he will vote in favor of.

Where this leaves us is a nice opportunity to bet that the vote will go in favor of Franklin and Starboard which should lead to a spike in the short term share price.  Let's look at the facts: 

- Newell has been terribly mismanaged to get to a point where they are trying to unwind half the company despite many of these brands having synergy

- The recent string of board resignations culminating with the resignation of Kevin Conroy who then [threw his support](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-newell-director-indicates-support-200000216.html) towards Starboard is a strong indicator of the momentum starboard has among key shareholders

- With the share price popping 6% after the news of Conroy adding support to Starboard, it is clear general shareholder sentiment is in favor of the change in power

- You guys jizz over PE and this Newell's PE is currently low as fuck (5.6 TTM)

The premium for options have always been pretty cheap in my opinion for this company so join me in buying calls on what should be a nice short term spike when Polk inevitably gets booted.  I think Polk resignes before to avoid a humiliation, but the shareholders conference should happen some time in May so we will be buying the June Options.  I have currently opened up a small position at the 30 strike [proof](https://imgur.com/a/sD7MA) but plan on expanding into the 32-33 range until my position is comfortably oversized.  Feel free to reverse my trades I'm basically guaranteeing a win for Polk by posting here.

**EXPLANATIONS:**

* Methodology: Avg.  of last 6 months actual results * [1 + (YoY simple growth rate / 12)] -- simplistic, sure, but probably still better than the non-farm forecasters.

* Source: [worldeconomiccalendar.com](http://worldeconomiccalendar.com/)

* I'm only planning to do forecasts for the reports that have a ""three bull"" rating. I also **WILL NOT** forecast crude oil inventories because it's a fucking pain in the ass. If you can't live without a forecast for crude oil, just look at what happened over the last few weeks, count how many times it beat v. missed, and expect the trend to follow whichever there's more of (although you should also consider things like weather, prices at the pumps, and so on).

* ""Red,"" ""Boring,"" ""Green,"" are just for fun. I try to base them on real information, but don't get it twisted: THEY'RE GUESSES. If anything, I'm hoping people will take them as a springboard for discussion, since we really do need more real-talk.

    Red = bad

    Boring = markets are dancing around each other like those bitches in West Side Story

    Green = /u/MrTrader1's mom's dick

Guy fieri here and I'm at the diviest dive there is, the option chains. I'm here to find the tastiest options that will take your tendies straight to flavortown, so with that being said put your bibs on get your chequebooks ready and let's take a trip. 

Disclaimer: no strikes/expiries will be mentioned and I am in no way advocating you to take any of these trades. These plays are just, in my retarded opinion, the spiciest most zingy seasonings to complement the tendies on your plate. 

CALLS:

MSFT: daddy satya take me now. They've switched their focus from Windows to AI/cloud, and if that ain't enough for you then what the fuck is? 

CLDR: cloud is sooo hot right now. Maybe wait til earnings play out and IV dies down before jumping in, or maybe put in a market order for Monday at open. Idk. No one knows. 

DBX: did I mention cloud is hot right now? They're due their first piece of positive PR, so maybe don't take FDs like an idiot. 

RTN: missiles, baby. Trump wants to spend even more on defense this year and in addition to a 4.5b dollar deal with Poland this past week this baller ass company also won a 500m contract for radar systems with the good ole US of A. Iran/NK tensions are also good for the sector as a whole. She's a little S&amp;P sensitive though, so make your entry accordingly. 

GS: big daddy Goldman has earnings in a couple weeks. Catch the run up. 

RUN: oil bad solar good. Or at least that's what my fellow millenials tell me. Pain for tsla will be good for run, because of some retarded news article linking solar city and sunrun. Good performance this month, and she's been pretty quiet. 


PUTS:

LFIN: to LFIN or not to LFIN, truly, that is the question. He's a profitable company, you have to understand. Lower strikes were released and even though IV is through the roof the share price is certainly heading through the basement floor. 

FB: deadcat of all deadcats. Bull trap of all bull traps. The shit is only just beginning to hit the fan for social media I'm afraid. While it could have a green week I'm not convinced they're out of the woods by a long shot. Throw TWTR and SNAP in here while you're at it. 

STZ: liquor sales are getting hurt by all the dank lettuce on the west coast. They're on a runup to earnings rn but we know how that goes. Good company but I'm bearish. 

TSLA: elons thorny Satan dick better also come with billions of dollars to pay off their loans or tsla could be in for a world of hurt. Inb4 GE acquires and repurposes the gigafactory. 

WILDCARD:

SPOT: going to be the whackiest IPO in recent history. Do they make money? No. Do they have a massive cult following? Absolutely. No share lockup on this one and with a possible price of 48-120 bucks I'm thinking were headed more for the dump side. Let it play out and if the dump does happen, buy some calls once they're written, this company wants to do big things. If you're feeling ballsy, market order at open.

&gt; Since 1927, according to Ibbotson, large value stocks have compounded at 11.5% a year and small value has compounded at 14.8%. By contrast, big growth has gained 9.2% per annum and small growth 9.6%. Because of the magic of compounding over 75 years, these are staggering differences. One dollar invested in each index in 1927 would be worth today $35,957 if you had put it into small value, $4,802 into large value, $1,089 in small growth, and $820 in large growth!

Synchrony seems to still make a lot of money and had a tiny dip in profits. Still wriggling my way around their annual report to find how they still make money when you write off 5% of your receivables. Does anyone have any DD on this ?

It caused uncertainty in a lot of investors. The biggest of which, in my opinion are as follows:

* Rising Bond Yields (investors make switch when market volatile = less money in stocks)
* Geopolitical Uncertainty (North Korea, ""Looming"" Trade War)

There were others. Feel free to name them, but I believe these were two biggest ones.

Investors only chose to sell off stocks and buy bonds because of rising fear and uncertainty. But my overall point is that this fear has subsided. Peaceful diplomacy with North Korea, the tariffs having a better impact than a lot of fear-mongering journalists predicted, means that investors will buy more stocks (for the uninitiated, this will cause stocks to rise).

a) Why does everyone here think he’s a genius? He certainly seems very smart, but he falls hard.

I frequently post of /r/aspergers

I'm 100% certain our Lord and Savior is on the spectrum too. 

Many normies will say he is narcassitic. This very obviously not the case. The most simple and clearest major flaw with this assumption: Narcassists know very well about others emotions and how to take advantgae of them. They know how others feel and they don't care.

Autistic on the other hand, they don't know how others feel, but they do care equally about their well being. Once they find out empathy is needed, they look for a solution. This is evident is the stack of 60 letters the judge reviewed, many attesting to how Martin helped people around him with personal healthcare costs, teaching, and so on. He was closely invested in their well-being. 

A Narcassist wouldn't ever care to genuinely help others. They might think to care, but then they woud take it away if they found out it wasn't serving them well. 

I wish his lawyer realized his autism is his best defense. He bascially has a social learning disorder. While he has a high IQ for certain analysis, he has a low IQ for how to act in the world. 

I feel for our lord and savior. He has been mistreated by society. Even most mental health professionals, and doctors do not understand autism yet. It is young. I hope he enjoys his time of solitude, because he really was one of us. While this is a meme for most, 'one of us' is IRL for the likes of me.

Dear Mr. President,

For the past three years, I have been an avid supporter of you and your methods of going against the ""status quo"" -  to do what is right rather than what is easy and popular. I watched in awe as you dismantled and opposed corrupt institutions and policies; a first among a long line of politicians weakly succumbing to public pressure and making bad decisions.

For this reason, I think it is vitally important that you consider pardoning Martin Shkreli for his Federal Crimes in order to release him from his, what I believe, unjust 7 year prison sentence. Public opinion has crucified Mr. Shkreli and accused him of crimes he did not commit and evils he does not possess. It is my interpretation that the judge presiding his case succumbed to this public vitriol and ordered an unfair sentence to Mr. Shkreli when a closer examination of his situation demonstrates that he is not nearly as guilty as he has been made out to be.

I am certain that upon a close examination of the facts, you will come to the same conclusions, and so, I implore you to consider pardoning Mr. Shkreli if not for the sake of justice, then for the sake of the public good he has performed and will be able to continue performing once he is released from incarceration.

Thank you,

(your name)",,83gl1j,,0,,false,1522284489,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/83gl1j/shkreli_can_be_pardoned/,,,,,

Anyone that bought AMC calls low and sold when it doubled made it out like bandits. Shoutout to the scrub that accused me of Dunning Kruger. Dude, being happy about a huge gain isn't DK syndrome GTFO.

Next move - Barnes and Noble. We all knew it would miss, but those of us that don't like being IV crushed bought puts and sold before the conference call. I personally got in (3/16 5.00 Put) at .6 and out at .8 -- some did better but fuck it 33% is 33%.

Next - Costco. I picked up some 3/9 195 Calls. Going to do a premium play here. AKA dump these before earnings or 50% gain - whichever comes first. Either way should be in the green IMO. 

[Sales trends](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-costco-cost-set-to-beat-earnings-estimates-cm929014) overwhelmingly favor a beat. This matters for different reasons though, since the plan isn't to hold through earnings. Positive sentiment (+ a slow run-up in the next five trading days) is clearly going to pump up the value of the premiums.

Case in point : a $1.87 haircut down to the high 180s only knocked the call in question down 37 cents. Options traders clearly agree COST is in good position with its sales and guidance (they selling cars now wtf?)

I don't feel like getting gangbanged by IV, so I wouldn't hold through earnings, but this is clearly a nice premiums play for novice traders like me.

COST 3/9 $195 Calls to the moon. Currrently $2.23 - consider the boat missed if you can't get in before $2.50. If you can, free money IMO.

3) purchase land form all white South African farmers at insane prices but in a structured buyout

4)lease the land back to the farmers for the same amount as the buyout payments

5)insure the 20 year lease terms for yield and land value

6) SA government confiscates them anyway

7) collect the default swap insurance policies on the leases and use some of the proceeds to resettle white South Africans

8)use rest of payout to short SA companies listed on foreign exchanges

9) substantial holdings have been repossessed from an American company, ask Trump to embargo SA. ( Venezuela'ed )

The fall from its high has been over a month, now at RSI 30.  Checking out average length between falls and rebounds over past 5 years is 2 months. I grabbed April 6: $67.5 calls with full expectation of this stock being in $70-$72 range by then.

Potential return on initial contract cost will be 50%-100% in a month.

I’ll post back on here the final results. 

Results: made a nice killing on the early March calls.  Got cocky, bought more as it dropped again, took a cold shower and lost my ass.

Personally I think UPS probably has the most upside due to the overblown Amazon threat, Amazon makes up about 7% of their top line revenue with razor thin margins. Shipping with Amazon will still be in beta for quite some time until amazon develops the infrastructure to be able to ship majority of their products and until then they're still heavily dependent on USPS, FDX and UPS. 

Walmart is were all the poor people shop, I think they noted that their online sales makes up less than 5% of their total revenue meanwhile their same-store growth has increased.

JD. Mothafuckin, ""untouchable"" JD. Not one green day this week, as it plummeted as low as 15% this week before stabilizing at -10% as CEO Liu bent over for Papa Ma, as disclosed in the sexual assault SEC filing it shared with investors. Closing the week at a very distant $43.78. 

SQ whiplashed left and right, holding third until JD tanked. Falling to 43 after earnings and then spiking to 48 for like 5 min, SQ ended up stabilizing at 46, where it closed the week. High PE? Perhaps, but who gives a fuck. Stocks only go up, anyways. My barber started taking SQ and he's 85 years old, time to go all in. 

And let's show some love for BIG PAPA SANJAY. MU climbing 5% on the week before tanking on that orange faggot's steel semi-boner and regaining it all at close of week, only 60 cents or so from our prior meme high. MU IS NOW COMFORTABLY IN FIRST. 

The race stalled somewhat this week, but props to MU for staring the red market in the eye and shitting dollar bills throughout (MU's market maker must be colorblind, but we'll let the poor autist believe he earned his position instead of being offered it out of pity - GS already hired the special needs quants and they had a quota to fill). 

Per last week's popular request, ROKU has been added to the meme race. IDK why the fuck why, because the tards who voted to add roku as a late entry last week (I'm looking at you u/avgazn247 &amp; u/Brunoob) must have been looking at its chart upside down. Down 10% this week and rumor has it the new Roku Premiere+ will come packaged with dildos so they can continue fucking themselves.  

INTC has been dropped as it isn't a meme stock and technically  already won. Who the fuck wants to watch Usain race a group of quadriplegics? (lowkey I would anyways..... I'll take the 1:10000000 odds on Stephen Hawking in case Bolt sprains his ankle)

Last I heard, AMD was giving Kimmy Jong Un's little pencil wiwi a blowy in the stadium bathroom but it may have been a north korean choir boy, idk they all have the same haircut. 

All in all, an interesting week. My account closed up $144, a staggering 0.31% , holding a weak AB (Ally Bank) Coefficient of 0.20 (0.3% / 1.5%). Mostly because I sold some SQ on the dip and then bought JD right before they tanked, in typical quant fashion.

I was at one of those “millionaire habits” presentation(mainly because I had the day off and figured I wouldn’t lose anything by just listening to it) and what it ended up being was about stocks. They explained put options, call options, straddles, Etc. 

Now their selling point was a training session and with that training session they would give you access to their stock software. From what the person explained the program basically analyzed everything for you, and then he went on to explain how the charts the program does works. 

Basically 2 lines, one is a 15day price average the other is a 50 day price average, and when the 15 day average is higher than the 50 day one that’s when you should buy. When they intersect again and the 50 day is higher again then you should sell. 

My questions are the following:

1- is this basically how most of these programs work? 

2- is that a viable/proven way of determining to buy/sell stock? Like when the 15 day line crosses over is it always going to be a buy because it’s making money or does it just zig zag and then the example they gave us was just a very obvious one? 

3- if this is not the way others work/if it’s not viable, what is the more viable way of analyzing and projecting stock data?

4- what are programs you guys use(if any), what is the price, and why do you use that one vs another one? What is the average success using the program you use?",,8148go,,0,,false,1522237387,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8148go/stock_software_question/,,,,,

Look boys. I care about you. I'm not sayin its 100 percent, but look at how the market is currently trading. Will it Bounce again on this bearish channel? Perhaps. But I really really doubt it, and if it does, it'll probably be at most to like 276. 

Today in my mind cemented the fact we've entered a bear market. Wheres the bottom and how quickly will it come? I have absolutely no idea. Theres going to be a period of disbelief while stragglers to the new mindset keep trying to buy the dips. But once the dip buyers get burned hard enough they'll say fuck it and start to cover losses, then the bottom falls out. 

I hope I'm wrong. I hope I'm a huge faggot. I'm putting my money where my mouth is an holding 100 pct into cash, 150k, and day trading weekly spy options in the mean time. 

Flipped some puts for 140 pct gains today. Learn to trade options if you want to keep making money. 



P.S. 

If I am wrong, I will feel very stupid and bad for missing out on all the sweet sweet gains but will not be eating a shoe.

I know $MU is a meme, but literally everything is looking up for them. Technicals are looking real nice, especially after the EOD run up. PEG ratio is is right in the sweet spot. They've been beating earnings for like a year now too with more and more business flowing in every week. The only stopping me from throwing my cash at weeklies is the fact that itll take me a few months to rebuild my capital if I lose it all, and I wouldnt want to miss out on tendies for that long.

Because the Chinese ruling/political class has both the political power in China and is invested heavily in the Chinese, U.S., and global markets.

-------------



China is starting to get a middle class. But largely, there are poor citizens, and there are the ruling class. 

The political ruling class are rich. More so than those that the rich in the U.S. Think of Russian political nepotism on steroids. That's China. 

Deposit insurance (like the FDIC's coverage of up to $250,000 of bank deposits) is also relevant. In China, you're covered for up to **only** about 80.7k USD. 

&gt; China’s cabinet announced on Tuesday that a long-awaited deposit insurance scheme - covering 99.6 percent of depositors for up to 500,000 yuan ($80,700) each - would be launched on May 1 [2015].

[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banks/china-bank-deposit-insurance-could-tilt-competitive-landscape-idUSKBN0MS3XG20150401
)

What does that mean? Well, like rich people in America, many of the rich have their net worth in the MARKETS. Probably largely the Nikkei 225 and U.S. equities. Sure, probably some bonds (including U.S. bonds), and other assets like realty (plenty of land in China). But LOTS in the equities markets. 

Do the Chinese political elite want a trade war? The Nikkei was down like 4% in one day last week. Does the ruling class like seeing their net worth go down by 4% in a day? Fuck no. 

You're not going to see a trade war because the Chinese political class benefits exactly ZERO from one.

I have been long nvidia for a while and have been relegated this past week, calls down 40% puts up 25% until I sold for stock on Friday. After January nvidia climbed to 240 before tumbling down back to 215 during the correction and instantly climbed back to Ath's after earnings. From that point it has been a constant fluctuation from highs of 250's to lows of 230's. Last week while nvidia recovered 3% from drop the previous day, Jenson Huang's appearance at IBM Think and brief discussion about A.I. made nvidia increase another 2% to finish off the day. I think it's a similar situation to what's going to happen in tomorrow's keynote. After two years everyone is expecting the very successful Pascal line to be replaced with Volta. Volta was first released back in December with the titan volta. A constant fear has been that nvidia may end up not announcing a new product line in order to meditate the risk of having miners flood the market with cheap gpu's while they buy up new ones. The consumer gpu's still account for over 60% of their business and nvidia continues to have a disgusting lead in market share in comparison to AMD so I see likely possibility that they will end up delaying the volta line. That leads into my strategy, I want to sell all my shares and buy up OTM calls and puts for April 6th. I see it very likely that nvidia breaks out of the 250 zone and runs in a gtc 2017 situation or drop on over exaggeration on a proper business move to keep their base.",,87fyj0,,0,,false,1522363087,false,self,t5_2th52,false,options,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/87fyj0/nvidia_gtc_and_analysts_day_play/,,,,Options,

Was this sell-off warranted across the market in general, and more specifically did these Mega-Cap stocks deserve this type of reaction? It seems to be consensus that China benefits more in its trade relationships with the majority of its G7 trading partners. However, trade representatives from the US and China have issued statements reporting that trade negotiations are occurring and that both countries are not interested in a trade war.

As a result, US equity indices rallied off the lows from Friday with Mega-Caps posting sizeable gains. However, this morning, the US announced an emergency law to curb Chinese takeovers to protect the US tech sector. Is it time to shrug off this announcement and be contrarian?

What I've been doing recently is paying for data from online sports books, would rather get into the vegas data, but anyways the data tells me total # of bets placed on either side vs total $USD on either side. So you can see where the ""smart money"" pro gamblers are doing. Then I keep that in mind while watching the scores, wait till i can get an in-game live line that's like twice as good as what the pros were already doing, then bet that.

I really like this strategy. Also, for huge games like Alabama vs. Clemson the first time they played in the natty, I think like this- everyone and their brother is going to bet Alabama because of their staying power, also tons of degenerate gamblers from alabama, so I think line is overvalued towards alabama and bet clemson, etc. Keeping in mind that Vegas is a business and likes to safely make money on the vig rather than take more risks

Explaining the Reasons - Damon Verial","I would wager that the bloated valuations - which we all knew were unsustainable - are reaching a (temporary) tipping point. The two year rally, especially in the tech sector, was an anomaly. Stocks were curiously more ahead of their earnings than usual for the past two years on hopes and expectations, and today many of those who have become pessimistic over the last year, are dropping their exposure.

A stock such as Qualcomm (QCOM), for example, has negative cash flow and earnings growth, all while sitting on a market cap of $86B. Emotions and expectations can only carry a stock so far until unimpressive fundamentals' divergence from the story leads to action. To investors holding such a stock, the risk of exposure to a company with expectations that contradict reality catches up with them, and the money is moved elsewhere, often outside the market and into bonds.

...and this brings us into the conspiracy part of the explanations that accompany a day such as today. As the Federal Reserve raises rates, the US treasury is aiming to dump their $300B worth of bonds. Of course, they wish to sell when the price is high.

If you follow this train of thought, you get a partially manipulated movement that drops the markets but raises bonds. Right afterward, you get a large bond sale that presses down bond prices, bringing the market back up. Basically, this drawdown is temporary.

It's nerve-wrecking and almost impossible to know the direction of the markets (especially when you put Trump into the mix). So what's the solution? High-frequency trading (HFT). I'll admit that I don't know (nor does anyone know) exactly what metrics specific HFTs use or what their algorithms are. However, what we do know is the volatility builds arbitrage opportunities. This is HFTs bread and butter. Just look at the chart of $VIRT since the end of January (beginning of market volatility). Albeit, you won't be able to get 100% returns in a week, it does require trust and their is risk involved. However, I think that $VIRT is a reasonable choice given the current
market conditions.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/81j3og/suffered_some_huge_losses_this_week

The highest rated comment advised me to stop trading options since I obviously didn't know what I was doing.

I actually had 2 accounts each with about 12-14k in each them. It was my TDA account where I lost that money. The next day  though I got approved for options on RobinHood, did I learn my lesson and resist temptation? Nope, my autism runs deeper than that.

Quickly lost 8k on that account and another 3-4k on my TDA account. In total I was down to maybe 5-6k out of my initial 24-25k.

Did I learn my lesson? Nope. Took out a few thousand on a credit card cash advance to bolster my capital and spent every dollar I had and then some on more options.

Now you probably all know what's coming next, me losing the rest of my money and going into debt. Except that's not actually what happened. I spent 100% of my money on Longfin puts when it was trading above $60. Made pretty much all my money back and might even come out ahead a fair amount when it's all said and done.

TLDR: Yolo'd too hard and lost most of money , yolo'd even harder and got it all back.

He might escalate the current trade war, start a real war in North Korea to distract the country from the results of the Mueller investigation, and send SPY puts and the VIX to the moon. [Serious post]","This past week has been interesting in the markets. Today and yesterday especially. 

We have a president who is not afraid to set the world on fire, so to speak. He has no qualms about destroying the current world order (which has been so good to commerce and the stock market so far). 

Trump's first year was marked by restraint, thanks to his advisers. A tax bill was drawn up and passed, and no one went to war. However, as he has gotten more comfortable with the authority vested to him as President, it appears that Trump's darker instincts have taken hold. And as we all know, one of Trump's most consistent views is his disdain for international trade and desire for autarky. 

We got a trade war this week. I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate. He believes that tariffs will force America to make its own stuff again. That is the true aim of this trade war, it's to dissuade firms from importing from abroad and make their own stuff, and employ American workers in the process, to bring about America's former manufacturing prowess. 

It is a fundamental ideological view he has held for more than 30 years. We need to sell more to other nations, and attain a high degree of self-sufficiency. That is how countries ""win"" at trade. 

Trade wars are devastating. I believe that Trump will escalate the matter further. He does not believe in negotiating, only brow-beating. May 1st is an important date to watch, as it's the date that the exemptions to steel tariffs ends for certain countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, South Korea, et al. 

The result of a trade war is increased inflation, as consumers pay more to get their stuff. Increased inflation will pressure the Fed to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, and with that goes economic growth and the bull market. Banks are especially under pressure. While increased rates help net interest revenue, if fewer people are borrowing as a result, why would it even matter?

The second threat to the bull market is political instability from the 2018 mid-terms and the Mueller investigation. Trump feels threatened by these two things. If Democrats take back the House, they can start restraining him a little. Mueller could release a report that puts Trump in a poor light and perhaps recommend him for impeachment. Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things? He could start a war. 

With hawks like Pompeo and Bolton on board, I believe that Trump will launch some sort of first strike on North Korea to distract everyone from the results of Mueller's investigation and undercut Congressional authority in the name of ""national security"". 

The results of a Second Korean War? Supply chains to Asia will be disrupted, an important trading partner will have its economy flushed down the toilet, and increased government spending to fund such a war will stretch the United States' financial resources to the limit. 

Look at the charts from yesterday and today. Massive downward selling pressure on high volume towards the end of the day. BTFD is seemingly gone. The market is nervous about the possible things President Trump could do and is re-pricing assets accordingly. 

Conservatively, there's not much one can do. If you are long call options, it's time to GTFO. If you are long stock, and have a time horizon of more than 10 years, it's fine to continue holding (but it will bleed in the meantime). 

If you are 100% cash, I recommend that you stuff 75% of it into a savings account. Use the other 25% to sell long-dated OTM bear call spreads, purchases of long-dated index puts, or long-dated VIX calls. Perhaps even gold mining stocks if you like gold, since it's always a safe haven. 

Tread carefully.

Why i think the bull market is about to end.","As a Perma-bear who has not at all been surprised of the declines in the stock market, i plan on buying $USO and $GLD options months out. I am looking at $GLD JAN $220 calls, and $USO JAN $20-21 calls. I don't think i will be buying puts on the stock market but rather focus being a bull on commodities since i think the fed will at some point step back in with some more Qe or something else to prevent losses in the market 


I believe the markets have peaked and that last autistic surge in Jan was the melt up, and we are about to enter a new chapter in economic instability. One word: Stagflation. 

 There are many underlying problems in the markets right now. I will list some key points and i would like other opinions on this. 

&gt;1. The United States has a unsustainable debt problem, and rising interest rates. The question begins if the United States can service its debt. Not only that we now a looming trade war, and a white house that continues to be berated with controversies.  



&gt;2. The bond market:  We are seeing bond yields at the moment move lower due to the fear in the stock market as investors move to less riskier assets such as treasuries.  This is a short term move lower as the fed will need to continue to rise interest rates in order to prevent inflation. The problem with this is that with rising interest rates it will get harder for the U.S. to service its debt, and with that investors and other countries will see this as a red alarm and stop buying treasuries or if push comes to shove countries like Russia, and China could sell. This morning, the Chinese have already suggested the strategy of not coming to the treasury auctions anymore due to the tariff situation




&gt;3. U.S. Dollar: You are already seeing that even with the fed being more hawkish and rising interest rates this past week, the U.S dollar continues to fall making commodities like gold and oil the go-to. I see this continuing.  This situation is linked to our debt problem and the huge supply of dollars and weak demand for our dixy.




&gt;4. The United States is leveraged to the teeth, because the only way to get out of this debt problem is sustainable, and consistent growth which i believe is not realistic.



&gt;5. The 9 year economic bull market or what i call ""the everything bubble"" that has been based on quantitative easing (artificial low interest rates-easy money). This has led to consistent but sub-par growth, but with now quantitative tightening this bubble is about to burst.



&gt;6. Libor rates: Nobody knows for certain why the bank to bank lending has increased to 2008 levels but it is something to keep a eye on. Maybe Deutche Bank is a canary in the coal mine


&gt;7. Geo-political turmoil: Whether the situations that are occurring in the middle east such as the Iran deal that may fail, would likely cause political, and economic turmoil making oil prices to skyrocket. The other looming crisis is the south china sea where china continues to exert its power in the creation of a artificial island in the name of security....the saying of trade wars likely turn into real wars would see a surge into safety assets like gold, and oil as a commodity that would thrive in economic and political turmoil.

However, TSLA has been very resiliant and particularly hard to predict in the past. My fear is that rather than fall below its support, it will trade sideways until the market decides what it wants to do.

For those of you wondering about my credibility, I'm a derivatives trader market-making on the SPX. I'll try and dumb things down to entry-level understanding but if something confuses you feel free to ask about it.

**Straddles**

The almighty straddle play. If you're a total beginner to options start here. You cannot trade options well without first understanding how to trade the straddle. To give you an idea of how important it is, traders often ask each other ""what's the straddle?"" to get an instant idea of what's going on in terms of volatility through that one price alone.

Imagine you own a straddle that's worth $5 and expires at the end of today. That means if the stock moves more than $5 in one direction you win. Real fucking simple. So if you think the stock will move more than $5 today, you think vol is cheap, and if you think it will move less than $5 you think vol is expensive. Most of you call vol IV on this sub, idk why, everyone here calls it vol so that's what I'm gonna call it.

Here's the interesting part. Not many of you seem to know what gamma is or how to trade it, but essentially long vol = long gamma = you get longer deltas as the stock ticks up and shorter as it ticks down. Accelerating returns. Real good stuff. So let's say we move $5 up on that $5 straddle we are long. The -50 delta put is now, let's say, -5d and our 50d call is now 95d. We went from flat to long 90d. Assuming a 100x multiplier on the contract that means our position now holds the risk (and benefit) of being long 90 stock. **This is where you want to hedge that risk by selling stock.** Don't sell out the straddle for a profit. Sell the stock and hedge back to flat delta to lock in your pnl. If the future keeps ticking up your short stock position is covered by the now-ITM call. But if the future ticks back down by, say, $5 and we land on the straddle, what happens? The pnl from the straddle goes back to 0, and both options are now 50d so the straddle has 0 delta too. But the short stock position makes $450, so we buy it back for the clean scalp **and we still own the straddle.** So if the stock moves again we get to rinse and repeat. Fucking VALUE BABY. 

**Calendars**

Now that we're rock hard, let's get freakier. Throw in another straddle that expires next week and we're shorting this one. It's going to cost more than the $5 one expiring today so we're receiving cash for this play, or long theta. Daily expiry straddle has a fuck tonne more gamma than next weekly straddle **so we can still scalp deltas**. That's some real good shit right there. 

Now we about to hit some meth and and things are going to get wild. I'm going to lose some of you here but that's okay, your non-retarded brothers-in-arms will march on. [The term structure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_backwardation#/media/File:Contangobackwardation.png) On that picture replace the word 'price' with 'volatility'. For structured indexes in a low vol environment we expect it in backwardation. That means on our calendar from before (called a straddle swap) we bought low vol and sold higher vol. I don't know how you fucksacks got it backwards but if you **buy low, sell high** then good things tend to happen. In the world of options buying low vol and selling high vol leads to **efficient** positions where the amount of gamma you get for the amount of theta you pay is really great. As your front straddle approaches expiry, you can roll your position by buying back next week's straddle to long and then selling the week behind's straddle. Here's where you can make extra cash by having a good feel for whether the straddle is expensive or not. If it looks a little pricey, ride the short straddle a little while before rolling the position. Moar theta.

Recently we've started seeing the term structure in contango, so short-dated volatility is more expensive than longer-dated volatility (I'm talking forward volatility here). Structurally this represents a significant demand for gamma. We tend to see this term structure when there's some kind of event-driven macro-level uncertainty going on. You know how the higher the vol of an option the less gamma it has?  Well volatility is back and in these higher vol environments you get less gamma for the theta you pay. **Stop fucking buying high.** It's all relative. Option premiums are more expensive now but there is always a higher vol you can sell. Work into spreads to give yourself efficient positions because you understand that high vol also means that **you receive more theta for being less short gamma.** Instead of trying to get as much of that sexy gamma for as little as possible, we're now trying to collect as much of that sweet, sweet theta as we can with as little movement risk as possible.

Happy trading cunts

Although china is notorious for manipulating their stock market and their dirty float currency. It seems the rhetoric about china not being able to maintain their dirty float.A free floating yuan may be coming soon. 
With that in mind along with the fact that billions of dollars may be sapped from their economy. As the effects of tariffs take hold. Shorting china seemed/s like the best play. We may actually see a gradual incline is the DOW and SAP as new tariffs will allow American companies to compete with foreign goods. I'll be on the look out to bargain hunt this week. Although the pain in the American stock market may not be over it should hit level out soon. Much sooner than i see china's leveling out.While bargain hunting i'll be avoiding industries that are being targeted by china such as Agriculture. I'm also about thinking eur/yuan in forex but it looks like i might be late to that party.

China may also stop buying treasuries. What does this mean? Rate hikes? Inflationary effects? Just what trump wants? Maybe? Is that a bad thing? not necessarily but knowing how to navigate the market when or if this happens is a good ticket to have in your pocket. How to play this is up to you. it's important to make the distinction between real rates and nominal yields and what effects each has on underlying securities and or assets.As well as what effect each will have on the market as a whole.As we move forward through the turbulence. Every investor should be familiar with market scenarios. 

If china is unable to maintain a dirty float with the yuan. The people's bank of china may not be able to continually maintain an artificial Shanghai SE Composite Index. We saw the PBC come in and buy, in order to prop up their markets on friday. I don't believe their buying power is infinite though.I look forward to finding more opportunity to short china. I also have to remind myself to be wary when doing so as they do manipulate everything and usually as a general rule.I do not dabble in the Chinese stock market but these are unusual times. As an investor i flock to returns short or long it makes no difference.
When long-term yields quickly outperform short-term yields (which we can measure using the Rate of Change indicator) we are likely to see a top in gold – usually a major one.

DD inside.,"So everyone is pretty panicked right now with Cohn resigning and what not. But let's take a look at the past month or so. Earnings for a lot of the giants came out, they're as profitable as ever and that trend looks to continue. Tax reform is giving these companies a big boost for the years to come as well. 

So, keeping that in mind, let's look at what has been thrown at the market so far, and whether or not there was a significant enough reaction to declare we are in bear territory:

Interest rates: no 

Fed chair: no 

VOLpocalypse: no 

Mueller: no 

Tariffs: no 

Cohn: no 

Seeing a pattern here? Sure, we've had some dips. But since vol peaked and we had our correction, we've retraced about 2/3 of the gains that were lost in face of all the stupid shit being thrown at the market. The indices are bending, but they are not in danger of breaking. The reactions are also becoming less exaggerated, and although it's memworthy I think a lot of this shit is simply priced in. The economy is just too strong at the moment to be tanked by steel tariffs or tariffs on whiskey and Harleys. 

All that being said, buy SPXL on the dip eevery time.

A dream of a free Shkreli that would make it rain tendies once free from his shackles of oppression and then it came to me on how we can help Papa Martin out. There is a website that we can petition the whitehouse with whatever problem we have, from SeekingAlpha not eating a shoe to why AMD won’t hit $15. My thought process is that if we reach the requirement of 100,000 signatures in 30 days or get a bigger following perhaps Overlord Trump will maybe eventually look at it and grant him a pardon. Compared to other securities crimes he is a pretty small time offender and Trump probably needs a new economic advisor so this would be Martin’s time to shine. It’s a win win. Shkreli doesn’t deserve all these sentences such with the penalties as giving up the Wu Tang album, essentially the Holy Grail of the rap game, or the assets he has to forfeit. He has helped us and now it is our time to help him.

Case for KRE Long Risk Reversal

-3M Vol is 5.2% over our forecast (reasonably fair)

-3M implied volatility is in the 18th percentile

-3M Skew is .52 standard deviations above its 1-year mean (puts are moderately expensive versus calls)

-KRE implied percentile is materially cheaper than XLF and SPY (XLF 3M percentile is 77, SPY is 90)

-A steepening US Swap Curve supports an improvement in net interest margins &amp; profitability for US regional banks

-Household Debt to GDP &amp; Debt Service to Disposable Income levels are at two decade lows

-While KRE is an equally-weighted ETF, the top 10 stocks by market capitalization explain more than 93% of the price variation on both a 1 and 2 year basis

-9 out of the top 10 stocks in KRE by market capitalization are Conviction Buys or Buys in our Large Cap Quant Model

They claimed to offer ""disruptive solutions for Fintech, Targeted Marketing, Predictive, Analysis, Market Research, Competitor Analysis, and Consumer Behavior Analysis.  A couple months ago their they release an extremely optimistic forward guidance expected to quintuple in 2018. They have an institutional holding of 16.38% which is quite substantial and notably one of their investor is CP group, a Thai Congolmerate who were the first to enter China when they opened their market to the world. Now this means absolutely nothing as they have money to throw around but it is important to consider that MARK has the eye of big investors. Unfortunately recent events have devastated the stocks and have investors scared. 

.

If you have not read about it, this was the Reddit I heard about it from. https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/7ctau5/you_need_to_check_out_ai_led_remark_holdings_mark/

MARK shows some weakness in their management and public relations as recent events unfolded but it uncertain what maybe the cause of it. The recent bogus report that claim MARK was fradulent was eventually deletedhttps://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2018_02_06_mark_external.pdf, but stocks eventually tumbled under 10$ which show never had happened. Unfortunately MARK's weak rebuttal that was clean and clear but vague on exactly what they do perhaps to maintain secrecy against other AI companies. Their CFO have also recently sold his shares. Now this may mean nothing at all and perhaps we can give them the benefit of the doubt and this is where part of the risk comes from. They could simply be fully focused on developing KanKan while maintaining their other subsidiaries, but without investors that cannot succeed. I'm pretty sure the people who were on margins were devastated. And because MARK is a small market cap they could simply be inexperienced with public relations.

.

The other part of the risk is simply KanKan is a unproven technology in their early stages.  Claims are simply claims, one that stood out to me is that they claim KanKan's War Room is like no other. This is just one of their many bold claim like quintupling of their AI revenue. But let see.

The reason why MARK stocks went up last week started with a confirmed contract, and days earlier before these event they showed an example of KanKan, followed by a report by Shanghai university.

On March 6 MARK signed a contract with 7/11 Thailand to deploy KanKan through 11,000 stores that is owned by CP group. This is incredibly important, CP group is not only investing but also implementing them into their system.  https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/970994294453604353 It goes without saying you shouldn't invest in something you don't understand and invest in what you use like shaq's wheaties/fruity pebbles deal. Now the example they showed (March 2), showed absolutely nothing of value to the everyday investor, https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/969595666040147970 I am not tech expert but I am pretty sure its complex to track movements.

On March 8, Shanghai university wrote a report on Kankan which is unfortunately deleted. https://twitter.com/jgrim375/status/971809430776971268?s=19 I actually forgot but I do remember they are would like to enter the Japanese market, although a weak growth economy they have a market opened to innovation. In a country high dependent on tech this would be fantastic if they could.

Other big news that I don't think people caught on was Ping-An on cnbc spoke to use their AI system. And guess what AI they are planning to use. Your's truly KanKan. I don't think most people caught on since they didn't specifically state KanKan. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/08/17/ping-an-is-far-ahead-in-using-a-i-in-the-insurance-business-exec.html

We want a a strong China in the coming months. We do not want a recession but that recession will not becaused by the steel and aluminum tariffs. There are a helluva more things that can topple the Chinese market before this. According to federal info we receive only 2-4% of steel from China, the concern with this is that there is some belief that steel is being shipped through transshipment by shipping raw material to other countries before the entering the US and that is what we record. Tracking transshipping is incredibly hard so it is uncertain. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/ But shipping steel is also really heavy and expensive it would be absurd to transship (this is purely my opinion it wouldn't surprise me that china is doing it like russia is murdering journalists), there are claims that china is flooding that the market with steel at a loss  in order to curb production but of course china dismisses this. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36099043

So why is this important, it is not. This will not affect MARK as long as mark can attract subscription based customers from any market sectors.

Forget 7/11, who the hell cares in fact, we want China and Japan but more importantly CHINA. Forget the tiny deal with 7/11. China is leaning towards being wallet free in major cities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75AXINUL47g Where we concern ourselves with privacy in the states. The chinese have allowed Alibaba and Tencent access to massive amount of consumer data. In china everyone is paying with either alipay or wechat (tencent). KanKan's supposed ability would be an invaluable tool and entering the Japanese market who are obviously technologically advance would be just another happy aneurysm.

other stuff mark do and there are more this is one of them - credit score through social media that banks in china uses as a credible source.
.

The dip that came on Friday, and it is barely a dip dropping only 12 cents. MARK still shows some strong RSI. EDIT infact it is back up today.

.

TLDR: Don't fear MARK. Invest in what your willing to lose. I am absolutely not responsible for your decisions. Do your own DD.

The financial sector has had tailwinds for the past 18 months: the US Federal Reserve began its path to normalizing monetary policy, US policy of deregulation, and most recently tax cuts. Although these tailwinds have been reflected with strong returns within the financial sector, Quantamize believes that regional banks still have significant upside. Our rationale is that the S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) still trades at a discount with a Fwd 12M P/E ratio of 14.8 &amp; a Fwd 12M EPS Growth rate of 25.9% providing a PEG ratio of .57. Additionally, the US Swap Curve has finally begun to steepen which will translate into an improvement in net interest margins &amp; profitability for US regional banks. Providing macroeconomic support, Household Debt to GDP &amp; Debt Service to Disposable Income levels are at two decade lows. These points led us to analyze a high conviction trade idea which we posted in our Q-Options page which provides investors an attractive trade due to multi-factor &amp; quantitative volatility analytics.

A little Idaho company could take over the Intel giant or at least a large portion of its market share. I decided I could make a decent chunk of change or die trying. I set 25 $60 calls for March 23, the day after earnings. I woke up this morning to see the positions rise 300% to my astonishment I already beat this call. Sure I could wait and still make a lot more money but (I'm a pussy/faggot) I already have close to $6,000 in other Micron positions.

Trump proposes $60 billion on Chinese imports and restricts US technology take overs. China rebuttles with a $3 billion tariff on fruit and pork.....just a toddler throwing a tantrum. 

This is the US attempting to muscle China into obeying a fair trade agreement. The steel and aluminum tariffs earlier this month gave exceptions to US allies in exchange for leverage against China. The Communist state can not go against the entire force of the Western world. Xi knows his country will lose. The growth of his country has been entirely reliant on free trade. He must accept Trumps conditions or else millions will be protesting on Tiananmen Square in a few years.

If Trump succeeds, the US companies will be the main beneficiary. China imposes 25% tariffs on US car imports. If the US car company, say Tesla, wants to go around that, they would have to build a factory in China. This comes with complications as well since the government forces foreign companies to form ""partnerships"" with local firms. This decreases the margins of foreign companies and allows Chinese firms to steel foreign secrets. In the mean time, the Chinese government also provides subsidies to its own local car companies, helping them win market share in China. I believe this is one of the many hurdles that Trump wishes to eliminate with this trade deal. 

Buy the dip. Maybe end of day tomorrow or early next week. I think most people have no idea what's going on, especially Wall Street traders that are reactionary and rely on simple arithmetic for guidance. There might be a bigger dip if more moving averages are broken and algorithms continue selling off; I am suspicious that those might have changed due to the early February correction.

1521780782,wallstreetbets,soundofreedom,self.wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/86i52c/longfin_lfin_the_biggest_scam_of_2018/,247,185,,,LongFin (LFIN): The Biggest Scam of 2018,"**Summary**
Market Cap 4.937B
Earnings: None

LongFin (LFIN) is a $5 billion market cap stock promotion run by a professional Indian stock promoter whose share price is highly likely to implode in the next 6 months as toxic financing starts to result in significant share issuance. Assuming LFIN actually has any real business (and there are lots of reasons to believe the company is a complete and utter fraud), LFIN shares are egregiously overvalued trading at roughly 100x peak year pro forma revenues and over 550x peak year profit after tax for a business whose profits declined over 50% in 2017. While the stock is very expensive and difficult to borrow due to the stock’s very limited float, the stock does have a reasonably liquid options market. I recommend buying September $35 puts as the stock is almost certainly worth less than $5 share and probably closer to $1/share.

If you add up all the shares owned by insiders and affiliates of Longfin, of 75,150,200 shares outstanding, only 1,290,789 shares are actually available to trade, making the total available shares to trade just 1.82% of the total.

There is very little liquidity, which means the last place you want to be is selling shares short or selling calls, but it makes buying puts very appealing IF some of these shares become unlocked and sold before September. Incidentally in spite of its float of 1.3 million shares (1.8% of shares outstanding) falling well short of the 5% requirement for index inclusion, LFIN was added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 on 3/16. This has driven a dramatic increase in price which is not tied to fundamental value as index ETFs have been filling this newly required position.

On January 23rd Hudson Bay Capital management entered into a USURIOUS 52.7MM financing agreement which closed on February 13th. Under the agreement LFIN will pay Hudson Bay $3.5 million in stock, and has the option to take at its discretion up to 3x this amount per pay period, all in stock. On the 13th of each month, starting in May, Hudson Bay can take $10.5MM in stock and dump it into the stock market. MAY.. JUNE.. JULY.. AUG.. September.

With Hudson having the option to collect shares and sell 50% of the current float in 6 months, this could tank the stock all on its own. This is all assuming it doesn't get delisted for blatant fraud.

This doesn't include the 2MM shares worth $120 million paid to Adamson Brothers to promote the stock which become unlocked sometime before June 11th

They are being sued by a former promoter Krishanu Songhal for 3.3MM shares owed for promotional activity which is roughly 3TIMES THE FLOAT

They also may not be able to get CohnReznick to sign off on their audit report and delay a 10k filing. Which would probably result in increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies and shareholders.

Oh, and the SEC or NASDAQ could just halt trading realizing that the entire thing is a scam

Market cap has risen 20% recently from $4 Billion to 5$ Billion and their headquarters are still an unoccupied coworking space in NYC

I am happy to provide evidence for all claims made and provide answers to any questions regarding this position. I own a significant position in the aforementioned puts and will post proof if needed.

**EDIT:** [Proof of ownership of LFIN Puts](https://i.redd.it/wxokkuwr5jn01.png) I've got $4000 in unrealized losses. If I am right I will probably have somewhere in the range of $20-$40k in gains

**EDIT numero dos:** 

If the stock is delisted from option trading but still trades,usually, they do not add new series of options but trading continues in existing options out to the farthest month in which there is current open interest. If the stock is delisted from trading then it's worthless and puts are worth parity.

Although I honestly believe these guys will delay their 10K filing, will ultimately be investigated by the SEC for fraud, and the shares will go to approximately $0.

So here's what we do: keep shipping Thai whores to Jack Ma until his giant head can't take it anymore, and he sells his stock to live a relaxed life in the Hollywood hills. Meanwhile we buy the dip and re-sell when BABA skyrockets after electing holographic Steve Jobs as their CEO.

Part of it was due to banks selling more and more derivatives and other new financial instruments and drastically increasing their debt to equity ratios.

The problem was that so many of the banks' bets were leveraged on debt, not assets, and the financial instruments were so complex that they didn't even understand what they were selling.

So if banks don't even understand many of the complex financial instruments they sell, I doubt 99% of WSB does.

Why bet your money on them then? Roulette is much simpler to understand. Ball goes in spinny wheel. Keep doubling down on your losses until you make it big and boom you got a yacht. It's basically foolproof.

I was sitting in the bagel store this morning and the news was showing in detail how to lock down your privacy settings and see what apps you have unknowingly installed. 

--BUT--

When it comes to things being a complete shit show in social media and potential foreign manipulation, isn't TWTR a much bigger issue? I think there's a reason TWTR dropped big yesterday too. The calls for regulation and investigation into how it is a threat to our democracy could potentially hurt the world of 50,000 Russian bots tweeting the fucking president with Jack Dorsey asking the world for help on how to make their service more healthy much more than Cuckerberg and his oops moment where someone used their data inappropriately. Sure TWTR is potentially trying to kill SNAP but with privacy becoming a concern, people aren't going to want their kids taking selfies of themselves and posting them on Twitter and adults don't do that shit. SNAP's network is much smaller in terms of who can see your pic if they aren't following you. 

Sure, the FB thing could be far worse than we know right now. But start imagining TWTR without Trump, with regulation on ads, and without all those fake troll army accounts and see what that does to their forward looking earnings.

I know you're always looking to improve your products and services, and 99% of the time you are on point. However, your latest move away from the Google Finance setup was a move in the wrong direction. I'm involved with several investing communities throughout other websites (Yahoo, Reddit, etc.) and all of them conclusively agree, the new Finance layout is awful. The helpful parts of the old format were the ability to check out individual stocks with an easily usable chart with customizable features within it. ALSO, it was critical to be able to see the most recently visited stock tickers along the left panel of the screen while also being able to track your portfolio picks on the right side. This was an extremely powerful tool to watch the entire market from a single screen. Now, we have been limited to looking at ONE stock with very weak user interface on the actual chart. Technically, you could say we have a ""portfolio"" view, but it's clunky and only 3 or 4 stocks fit on the screen at one time. I want to see a compact list of stocks, their current price, and their day's change (either in % or $). Until Google makes a move back towards this interface, I will definitely continue to seek out other options. I can confidently say that the new Google Finance layout *hurts* my ability to track stocks and make informed decisions on multiple securities in a single day. 

Faithfully yours in other areas,

DD:  
  
Really have mixed opinions here. Short interest is surprisingly low, so maybe its not oversold, but it's clearly been called out as a loser plenty by analysts, and it's way down in the last week, month, 6 months, year, etc.  
  
GE seems to be having a hard time making a profit, and it sounds like there's some sort of restructuring going on. Between the dividend being cut and the last earnings report, things haven't been good for GE. however, their market cap is close to their annual revenue (mkt cap 120B vs annual revenue ttm 121.5B), so if they can turn things around it could pop up.  
  
My thoughts are that the next earnings report (4/20/2018) has a good chance of triggering a large movement in either direction. The expectations are considerably lower than in the past, and if they can meet or exceed them, especially with all the negative press, the stock price could pop upward. Likewise, if they can't meet even these newer, reduced expectations, confidence will continue falling and may result in a big drop.  
  
With that in mind, im looking at an options play with a 5/18 expiry (to allow for a run either direction after the 4/20 earnings). Furthermore, options (at least the closest ITM to current price) look relatively cheap. A call would need a 3% increase or so to breakeven and a put would only need a little more than 1% decrease.  
  
I'm holding off on opening this til after the Fed meeting to reduce uncertainty at the time i open the position.

If governments are having such trouble documenting everyone and keeping information of them then just imagine how difficult it is for one entity. I believe God is struggling to keep track of the various amounts of people. Also the limited number of angels used to keep track of us is dwindling down. Reports say many angels are putting in 60 hour work weeks with unpaid overtime. But what does Facebook and Google have to do with this? I believe in the near future that they will grow and eventually be in charge of counting the good and bad deeds of every human in the world.

We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.

Here's a timeline of the events:

In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.

In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.

In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today.

In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.

Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened.

This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.

In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people's information in this way. But there's more we need to do and I'll outline those steps here:

First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well.

Second, we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in -- to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more changes to share in the next few days.

Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.

Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.

I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.

I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.",,8653ql,,0,,false,1522336492,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8653ql/message_from_the_zuck/,,,,,

So I have been testing this strategy in a demo account so it's been going well so far. Going to use real money once my pay comes in next week.

After kicking the shit out of myself and realizing I'm a fucktard dumbass bitch, I decided to implement a rule that if I had decent gains, and I set a trailing stop, to fucking keep it no matter what. And if it kicks in and the option sells, then to roll into some more options maybe a little further out of the money with some of the proceeds. Instead of sitting by and losing it all.

Hi everyone,

I am a college senior majoring in business and neuroscience. I became close friends with a neuroscience professor I work with, who asked me for advice on her financial situation. I told her that although I currently have been receiving high returns in my portfolio, I take exorbitant risks that she should in no way consider for her IRA or 401k.

It was at this point that I learned she does not have a IRA or 401k. Apparently, neither does her husband. Additionally, she does not have a college fund set up for her children. Her daughter and son are about to enter college and (In fall of this year and next year respectively) they are planning to ""pay for expenses as it comes.""


**retirement &amp; current income**

She has told me that her retirement plan is essentially ""die working here."" While she does not have a retirement account, working at this university until the day she dies will be her income stream into retirement years. Both she and her husband are currently in their late 50s. There is an opportunity for her to teach at a medical school where she could potentially receive more income. Her husband, has worked at a small business since his 20s. However, the owner of that business is hitting 80 and the owner's son is not very bright. Thus, that business will likely be sold where her husband will be paid in ~3 months salary. At which point, he will be out of a job and unable to find work. Her husband currently makes ~70k a year, something he considers to be significant as he does not have a college education.


**assets &amp; expenses**

At the moment, their biggest asset is their house. However, they do not expect to receive any financial help from their family members at any point (no trust funds, nothing left other in parents' wills). 

This means that they need to find to pay for their own expenses during retirement. 


**how to proceed**

Based on her situation, what do you guys recommend for her? I know about IRA and 401k (or 403b in the case of an university), what else should she utilize? 

What about her investments? How much should she reasonably set aside per year and how long can she reasonably work for? While she said that she plans on working until the day she dies, there comes a age where one is too ill to work. What is that reasonable estimate? Lastly, given that timeframe, should she be using a classic risk-parity portfolio or something more aggressive or conservative?


Thank you for all of your advice!

Using the 200 day MA and 50 day MA I planned on buying calls/put strikes at the MA price. 

Example: Stock ABC is trading at $20 but the 200 day MA is $25, so you would purchase $25 strike price calls.

Beyond my chimpish analysis of general market factors, the valuation looks stretched with no upside. With 8% discount rate and similar cost of equity, the current valuation assumes a constant long term 4% free cash flow growth, while the trend suggests closer to 2% - and that's assuming pretty aggressive revenue growth of 4-5%, which they haven't achieved once in the last 5 years. 

The only upside here might be benefits from reduced corporate rate and repatriation of cash effects. I looked into this briefly and found analyst estimates that 47.5b of the projected 54.5b is ""indefinitely reinvested in Oracle's foreign operations"", so there's not much of an upside there either.

**SWCH is a data center, colocation business that has more growth potential than its peers. This is because it is a data center company which is not structured as a REIT. REITS have to pay 90% of their earnings as dividends to remain classified as a REIT and reap those tax benefits. The large data center companies like EQIX and DLR are REITS because of the large amounts of properties they own. SWCH chose to be structured a different way, as a UPC, so they can reinvest their earnings back into their company.**


Switch has their main data center facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and this facility has an interesting story. In 2002, the CEO Rob Roy attended an Enron auction for this facility. The facility was built with millions of dollars, and Roy bought it for $930K. This was a clear and very strategic move by Roy, and these strategic moves have continued through the life of his company. I like this because it shows the CEO is very strategic, and his decisions have been smart and executed so far.


Comparison's of their locations to two large other colocations businesses, Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Trust Realty (DLR):


* SWCH has a fully operational campus called Core in Las Vegas. This is their primary revenue campus with a utilization rate of 94%, gross square footage of 2M, and power capacity at 275MW with construction of another facility bringing it up to 315MW. Their other campuses are a bit unnerving. They have a campus in Tahoe Reno with one operational building with a total of eight buildings planned. Their operational building in Tahoe is 1.4M square feet with up to 130MW of power capacity. These campuses in Nevada are connected through their proprietary superloop which connects lucrative California markets to these data centers. Smart, because they are paying the lower costs with lower chance of natural distasters for more data center space and are still connected to the large markets. Switch also has a facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They have an office building that is 660K sq ft, and one operational building with up to 20MW capacity at 680K sq ft. The other three buildings in MI with the rest 120MW power and 1M sq ft are planned. I am a bit skeptical that the majority of their locations are ""planned"". They also have a planned campus in Atlanta. They have SUPERNAP facilities in Thailand and Italy as well.


* EQIX has data centers located in Seattle, Silicon Valley, LA, Denver, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, among other locations. 

* DLR has the same locations, and Oakland, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Austin, Charlotte, NJ, and Northern Virginia. 

* The international business is important, but I want to focus on the North American portion of the business.


As you can see, SWCH doesn't have many locations but they are located stratetigcally with high quality centers. This is where quality over quantity comes in. I think eventually the cost of data will exceed expense budgets, and moving to a further out data center like the Las Vegas one would be a better budgetary option. 


Now to Financials, which is limited because they only have one quarterly report:


* To measure the health of this business, it's common practice to use a non gaap accounting method called Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for EQIX, DLR, and SWCH is $2.05B, $1.4B, and $195M respectively. Switch has a high estimate of $195M in adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2017. When we compared this to debt of 819M, we actually get a very attractive multiple of 4.16 for SWCH. EQIX Debt/Adj. EBITDA multiple is 2.67, while DLR's is 6.23. If we use EQIX Debt to Americas Adjusted EBITDA multiple it get's even better, a multiple of 6.69. From this measure, SWCH is attractive, but it's relative to the amounts of debt these companies have. Adj. EBITDA Margin is a good measure to look at too. EQIX is at 47% margin, DLR 58%, and SWCH 50%. 

* Cost of debt. Interest expense / Debt. This will be a measure to see if debt is resonably managed so it doesn't throw off the above multiple. EQIX has a cost of debt of 6.73%, DLR 2.97%, and SWCH 3.30%. SWCH is still attractive.

* Revenue. SWCH's nine month revenue for their colocation business is 226M which is 17% y/y growth. Their connectivity segment is 49M, 24% y/y growth. Full year 2017 revenue is expected to be within 372M-380M. EXIQ Revenue grew 21% to 4.4B in 2017, and DLR revenue grew 15% to 2.5B. SWCH has a small piece of the worldly pie, but a fairly larger piece of North America.


I have found some worries which I'll outline:

* Lawsuit from Cobalt Data centers. I investigated this and it looks like the CEO of Cobalt left SWCH, opened up business and failed, so they sued SWCH blaming them for monopolization of the Las Vegas region. Also, Cobalt doesn't even have a website, their domain is for sale.

* A lot of SWCH's facilities are planned, not even in construction. I looked on google maps at their Tahoe location and I didn't find much buildings there, there are construction vehicles though. It is next to the Gigafactory though, interestingly. I also couldn't find the facility in Thailand on google.

* Glassdoor company reviews tell a story of power hungry people and a negative company culture which fires anyone who brings up problems. Could be worrisome. Could also be the strict nature of mission critical businesses.



**Conclusion**


What this information has shown me is that the 13 operational buildings SWCH owns out of 24 planned has 10% Adj. EBITDA of EQIX America's Adj. EBITDA. EQIX is the largest data center business in the world, and SWCH is trading at a 4.7B enterprise value while EQIX is 36.8B. Low utilization rates in SWCH's other facilities show there is more revenue growth avialable. The only risk now is if SWCH doesn't execute their other facilities in a timely manner.


TL:DR SWCH is a data center company trading at 4.6B Enterprise value with 10% the Adj. EBITDA as the largest data center business in the world, and 14% of the second largest, DLR. If they finish their facilities they will have large revenue growth, and they are able to retain their earnings unlike EQIX and DLR.

https://imgur.com/7sgSz1j

It's kind of a daily binary option on SPX ending the day more than 15 points up. If it does, it closes at 100 and if it doesn't, it closes at 0.

I think this is free money. My hypothesis being that SPX surely can't keep on going up by more than 0.5% day on day so if I keep selling, I keep on the net gaining money. The contra argument was that SPX has been hitting ATH every other day for the past few years so there is no way this is going to work. However this bet still allows for SPX to increase as long as it's not by more than 15 points.

I analysed SPX from 14 Feb 2010 to 14 Feb 2018, most of which was during a raging bull period. 

Over this period, SPX ended the day by more than 15 points only 13% of the time. Even during the up days, it closed by more than 15 months only 23.8% of the time.

So historic data shows I should have a pretty good win rate selling this option. Please note there is no risk of unlimited loss as increase is capped at 100. 

The only sticking point is that the price of this position opens at different points. For the past few days it's been opening at around 20-30 to sell. so I could be gaining 30 pips for two days but lose it all as I lost 70 pips one another day, However it doesn't appear to go above 70 until late in the session, so that's a good stop loss. 

I am trying this out on a demo account atm. Just selling £10 a point at open, and leave it to close at end of the day. Made £217 yesterday and £231 day before. On track to making £168 today. 

I will do this for a few months and see what happens. If results are good, I will trade with real money but at just £1 a point.

I'll present the information and let you draw your own conclusion on Elon/Tesla's credibility going forward.

I'll also revise the format so it's easier to go through.

[May 2016](https://s.t.st/media/xtranscript/2016/Q2/13559022.pdf) | Tesla to produce between 100K-200K Model 3s in the second half of 2017.^[1] |  Tesla made 1,800 deliveries of the Model 3 [in 2017](http://www.autonews.com/article/20180103/OEM01/180109923/tesla-deliveries-q4-increase).


***

1. I have seen some interpret this number as an intentional exaggeration based on the fact that Musk later specified the initiation of deliveries on July 1st as ""an impossible date"". The two factors are easy to separate, though, if you look further down in the transcript. 

 Musk says,  
&gt;  ""I feel confident about the topline number, but the mix internally, it is difficult to figure that out. Maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then maybe 300,000 to 400,000 of 3, I don't know. It's really hard to say."" 

 Musk was obviously incredibly confident in a figure in the ballpark of a third of a million by the end of 2018, so it's reasonable to extrapolate that at the very least, 10% of that should have been done in 2017-even if factoring for the frequently mentioned ""production ramp"", which Tesla can never seem to get a hold of. We'll see if they can find the traction necessary to make it a reality. 

 Tesla has actually been sued [over the matter of failure in Model 3 production readiness](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/technology/tesla-shareholder-suit-model-3/index.html). They mentioned it themselves in their [Q3 2017 report](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-17-21343&amp;CIK=1318605): 

 &gt; On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding its preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

 I haven't seen any update on the case's progress but would update this if anyone has info.

***

I'm going to add a component to this which I feel is necessary because oftentimes when I see a post/comment which highlights Tesla's inability to meet goals and/or deadlines, a Tesla fan (or investor) comes forward and questions its significance within the overall market - usually against automotive competitors.

So, I'll compare projections for the Model 3 against the Bolt since those are both in the 200+ mile range EV segment.

I checked various investor materials from both companies' going back into 2012 and coming forward to 2017. In addition, I checked media reports for general events. Here is when each company made projections of availability for the respective segment entry, when revisions occurred, and the actuality:

Note: There were a handful of mentions of the Model 3 in terms of future outlook which dated quite far back. The [Summer 2011 letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/6055843436x0x494001/DD297293-EC2D-4DC5-8DB4-63D491FB6BD0/Company_Overview_Q3_2011.pdf) included a mention of the then-called ""Gen III"", but I didn't include them as they were relatively theoretical in manner and not projections in any regard. They actively disclosed the project was on a TBD-basis so I granted them the benefit of said disclosure.

Why do you downvote comments?

Is this your way of lashing out your anger on others from losing money?

We should make posts about lambos we gonna drive one day, not being mean and glorifying losing money.

Just some food for thought, would like to have discussion with you guys.

And to all you down voters who feel tough behind your screen, feel free to comment below your yearly profit and loss in terms of percent. Man up.

Mr. Powell, he is new xD... he is a boi, and will panic raising interest rates, and leading to a bond selloff the will grow dangerous. The price of debt will bring downward pressure on corporate earnings. The stock market will buckle under the weight, and ""my precious""; correction you precious gains will all be lost...

Please help us with our economics competition,"So I am in an [economics competition in the UK for sixth form](https://www.studentinvestor.org/), that is split in 2 phases. Our team started 1st of December last year.

**Phase 1:** With £100,000 of virtual money, using real stock markets, invest in FTSE-100 companies (and 50 others). Top 300 teams in terms of gains go through to the next round. This ended around 15th of January.

**Phase 2:** Every Monday we are given 4 stocks and their price/chart, we have to guess what the price will be on Friday end of trading hours. Closer you are in +-%, the more points you get. This began last week and continues for another month or two.

Basically for round 1 we went all in on these mining companies on 1st of Dec: KAZ, RIO, AAL. And we were in the top 20 of 3000 teams with over £26,000 gains by 15th of January. Lots of other teams followed the markets every day and did lots of research into the best companies, but we hoped that the mining corporations might find like a really big vein of diamond or copper so the share price would go up. Our other theory for why we made decentish gains was because a lot of people will want to buy diamond wedding rings in time for Valentines day (so they would be buying in December/January, raising share prices), and copper piping too I guess.

Please can you give any advice for Phase 2? We are currently in top 40 out of the 300 finalists in phase 2, our strategy so far is that we just looked at the stock charts and extrapolated up/down, I think our best team member has been rounding every closing price to the nearest multiple of 7.

**TL;DR: How do we guess what a share price will be in 5 days, we had some good strategies for round 1 but now we are given stocks to work out the price in exactly 5 days.**",,8204y3,,0,,false,1522254886,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8204y3/how_do_i_guess_the_price_a_stock_will_be_in_a/,,,,,

It seemed like they couldn't stop hitting the headlines with consecutive bad press. From [beating an old asian man](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/04/27/united-dragging-report-our-review-shows-that-many-things-went-wrong-that-day/?utm_term=.0fd81463637e) and [blaming the bloodied and bruised victim for being disruptive](http://deadline.com/2017/04/united-airlines-ceo-passenger-dragged-outraged-statement-1202067835/), to [forcibly wrestling a violin away from a costumer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/06/06/an-airline-tried-to-get-a-musician-to-check-her-17th-century-violin-a-wrestling-match-ensued/?utm_term=.1c487fc49491), just to name a few, they couldn't fucking stay out of the news. They also have the confirmed highest kill count of customers pets by [the US Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2017FebruaryATCR.pdf) (PDF warning, page 56 for details), ultimately responsible for more than 1/3rd of all animal related deaths, injuries, and losses for all US carriers.  
  
All that being said, you would think that all hands would be on high alert to avoid any potential bad press. After all, doesn't the management owe it to shareholders to ensure high quality service is provided to customers? Lmao, **fuck no**! In just the past 2 days alone, United Airlines put a 10 month old puppy into an overhead bin (and killed it) and *then* put a different dog on a flight from Denver, Colorado to Wichita Falls, Kansas on a flight to Japan. The dog was without food or water (not required for the 4 hour flight), as well as medicine it needed for an infection, for the entire 16 hour flight. Articles by [New York Times](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/united-airlines-dog-death.amp.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/us/united-flight-dog-mix-up/index.html), and others are already making the rounds on the morning news and social media. The volatility, general unease in DC, and other tensions could potentially see this recent development in United's confirmed track record of fuck ups finally take a big chunk out of their share price.  
  
I recommend taking a look at different short positions to take on United in the future. Should you be wary of United turning its life around and being less of a shitbag?

A lot of companies (mine included) didn't want to switch to a subscription based payment plan so we've been using CS4 for years. However, as computer OS keep upgrading, the Creative Suites are losing compatibility making it impossible to run. 

As companies upgrade their hardware and OS for security and performance reasons, they'll be forced to upgrade their CS software. Pretty soon nobody will be able to run CS software and they'll have to choose between a CC subscription or other software. 

Since ADBE is the industry standard for a lot of their software and it would be more expensive to change an entire pipeline just to avoid a subscription based fee, it's a good bet that subscriptions will keep increasing for the next couple years.

_____________

Autodesk (**ADSK**) is in a similar situation. A lot of the older versions of 3DS max, Maya, AutoCAD, etc are starting to lose compatibility with modern OS. Keep an eye on both as this software is essential for companies that built pipelines around them and they'll be forced to start paying for the subscriptions.

To get margin and options all you have to do is tell them you want them. So now you have traders with like $2000 plus $2000 margin in their accounts. If the market crashes, it's tough shit for the people who took out the loans because now they have margin calls. 

Normally I'd say thats not a problem because the fault lies on the trader. But when you have traders with $2000 to their name that just lost all their money plus $2000 of the brokers money, how is the broker supposed to get their money back? I seriously doubt someone with $2000 to their name will have the income to just drop another $2000 in to cover the margin call. Sure you could transfer  the debt to collections, but the problem still isn't solved until the debt is actually paid.

You saw how many RH accounts got destroy on the XIV implosion. That's only one security. If the whole market is falling like a rock, margin accounts will get killed left and right. Other brokers have made it through crashes before but they don't cater specifically to users with low funds/income that take high risks. That can lead to way more margin calls going unpaid, where RH takes a hit as well. Won't it hurt their business if they lend money that can't be paid back? How do other brokers handle this situation?

Tldr: Robinhood lends to users that may not be able to pay back margin calls in a complete crash.

I donno the aerospace rally is probably over.

Future catalysts : new generation fighters get shot down easily.

DD : Maneuverability of an aircraft is likely obsolete, why the US doesn't care about F35b being a bit chubby. It's all about offensive capability and who fires first or has reactive defense. Drones cover both those.

1521230482,wallstreetbets,CudderKid,self.wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/84yc7t/know_what_youre_invested_in_edition_1_jdcom/,54,208,,,Know what you're invested in - edition #1 JD.com,"Welcome to “Understand What you’re invest in” edition 1.0. These posts are intended to educate autistic traders about our most beloved category of assets, MEMESTOCK BOIS. This edition will cover one of my personal favorites, JD.com ($JD).


What:

 JD.com is an ecommerce sales company based in Beijing, China that deals in direct selling of consumer goods; JD does not have any brick and mortar sales locations nor does it manufacture any of its product offerings, all items are sourced from 3P manufacturers and distributors. JD also offers an online marketplace for vendors and consumers to host and purchase 3P merchandise. TLDR: JD is China’s “Amazon Lite” before Amazon developed web services and proprietary product lines.


Why:

 Two driving factors behind JDs potential for growth that we have all heard before; China’s middle-class is exploding and brick and mortar is dying. China’s urban household income is expected to double by 2022 (Mckinsey research). This will lead to a shift in total spending from the lower class to the middle and upper-middle class of Chinese households; meaning less of China’s total spending will be controlled by poors buying “needs” and more of China’s spending will be Alphas buying electronics, tailored clothing, household “Nice-to-haves” etc…


Let us look at the past 12 quarters’ revenue numbers to support this spending theory:


$5.9B


$7.4B


$7B


$8.5B


$8.3B


$9.9B


$9B


$11.6B


$11.1B


$13.6B


$12.6B


$16.7B


Estimates Q1 2018 15.6$ 


(B-b-b-ut Mr. fag trades, this is lower than last quarter!!! – holiday spending you dumb autist, this would be a 41.16% YOY growth for Q1.)


JD.com owns and operates 210 warehouses (~4 MILLION square meters) in China’s 50 biggest cities, as well as operating over 5,300 deliver and pickup stations. The distribution network is solidly established and DOES NOT include any storefront overhead.


Investor Snapshot: 
Market cap - $64B
Shares held by institutions – 55%
Short interest - 2.2%
30 day put/call ratio – 0.6
1 Year sales growth – 40%
5 Year sales growth – 54%
1 Year EPS growth – 104%
EPS growth forecast – 60.99% (1 year)


JD’s drop from all time highs resulted from a missed earnings in Q4 2017, where revenue actually BEAT. The miss can be attributed to JD reinvesting in itself:
“Despite posting better-than-expected revenue for the quarter, net income was down 17.7 percent at 449 million versus a mean analyst estimate of 666 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In a call with analysts following the release of the results CFO Sidney Huang said smaller margins were linked to investments in new business lines including logistics investments, overseas expansion, artificial intelligence and cloud services.”


Reduced PPS also resulted from another $1B infusion from Tencent and a capital raise campaign of $1.9B open to Chinese banks and investment firms. 


Available ratings:


Market edge – long


Reuters Research – outperform


Morningstar – 3 stars


Concerns:


Alibaba competition


Potential to take on too much at once (international expansion, AI, web services, etc…)


Chinese economic downturn


Expensive by P/E standards


Disclaimer: OP Is looking for an entry for about $5K into LEAPS (2019/2020) but currently does not hold any JD. However, previous calls on JD have all been profitable so I am slightly biased.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html

So NK is essentially saying “we will denuke if the US can remove itself entirely out of the South Pacific.”  Thatll never happen.

If the market Boosted gains this morning based on hopeful news, I feel itll retreat when it hears what actually happens and we, again, learn its Fatboys way of asking for more food.

Tell me why I messed up.,"I don't usually post here, I lurked for entertainment as I didn't think my trades were WSB worthy. Never much more than 5% in a single ticker, rarely options other than selling covered calls, Barely using margin. This dip buying is the most deviated I've ever been from my boring /r/personalfinance vanilla prudence. I was fully invested so dipped ~250k into margin to buy FB and GOOG so far (a little at opening and a little late morning). Potentially thought about dipping even more before had a brief moment of lucidity and decided to ask a question here before truly maxing margin.

Wasn't even in FB except for tangential exposure through small QQQ position. Don't know how I ended up so on tilt. 

My reading was that FB didn't seem to maliciously breach user data privacy, it was more Cambridge Analytica's intentional violation of FB guidelines. As such I can't imagine the fines being as astronomical as earlier suggested (if at all). 

I also don't understand why GOOG is so dragged down in this other than the relatively vague umbrella of ""data privacy"". Maybe this does spur new regulation on data rich tech, but I can't imagine what type of worst case regulation would butcher FB and GOOG in the long run? (Admittedly I'm not imaginative and haven't thought on this for very long)

Production cuts from OPEC have stabilized global crude oil markets ~USD$60/barrel for the short-run.  Now that global crude oil prices are stabilizing, where can investors and traders invest in energy?

Investors may want to consider US E&amp;Ps given that total cash break-even costs for US shale E&amp;Ps are estimated to be ~USD$40/barrel based on internal research at Quantamize. Forward multiple for the US Energy Sector look attractive with the S&amp;P 500 energy sector trading at a Fwd 12M P/E of 15.5x with an expected annual EPS growth rate of 30+% for the next 3-years; this translates to a PEG ratio of 0.5x which means the forward 12-month multiple investors are paying for forward earnings is at a discount to the rate of growth for future earnings. 

Over the past few weeks, Quantamize has highlighted a few attractive options trades in the US energy space: XOP (US E&amp;Ps ETF) Bull Call Spread and a SLB Bull Put spread.  When Quantamize highlighted the Bull SLB Put Spread, 1-month implied volatility for SLB was implying a 5 standard deviation downside move. In comparison, SLB as top name in our US Large-cap Multi-Factor Quant model. 

Investors and traders may want to consider future opportunities in the US energy sector given that valuations remain cheap while the prospects for the sector are improving sequentially.

Calls or Puts, Bulls of Bears, use a little caution. 

We're right at the upper resistance level of the bearish trend today. If it shoves up past it, it might be a pretty nice breakout that could swing for a few days. I personally think its more likely we hit 265 on SPY today and retest the lows of the channel.

Either way, be prepared to see 50 percent of your position vanish LITERALLY before you can sell. GL bros and may God be with you. Be patient with your entry points. Sometimes you'll make more money just waiting and trying to pile onto the trend once it really makes its decision for the day. Even then though, it might turn around instantly. 

Edit: I'm looking to short the spy if we get 269ish and will hold a bit past 270 but liquidate at 270.5; taking profits around 265 depending on momentum.

$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity.

- Needham, analyst Laura Martin, described Roku as ""next $1billion asset""



-- Lock Up Expiry = 03/27 -- DD from previous post:

The price has dropped from ~38 to just below ~32 and is currently oversold, due to:

- fear of insiders selling their locked-up shares for a profit
- market taking a dump after tariff announcement / rate hike fears

Initial Offering:
15,668,000 shares @ $14.00 = $219,352,000 (IPO Date 9/28/2017)
even at $34, the stock is up 242% from its IPO so some profit taking is expected.

- Roku was up 320% from its IPO price before dropping 34% from its 52wk high after crappy Q4 earnings. 

- ROKU is currently the leading OS for TV streaming, but has major competition from FireTV, AppleTV, AndroidTV. Simply put: the latter got mo' money. 
- They've been able to monetize by: advertising, subscriptions through ROKU, brand buttons on their remotes, etc. Growth is expected to grow from 29% to 32% guidance in 2018
- Past Performance: Annual ARPU growth by 48% and platform revenue by 138% over the past year.

Now the big one...lockup expiry

- Roku's 180 day IPO lockup is set to expire end of March 27th
- about 20 million shares outstanding, $14 IPO....current price ~$36. the concern is insiders wanting to sell to lock in gains and consequently tanking the price.


I am predicting that the stock is going to be oversold as the expiry date comes closer, and will be an opportunity for a nice dip.",,87aheu,,0,,false,1522359950,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/87aheu/its_time_finally_load_up_on_roku/,,Anyong Haseyo!,,,

Should I Revive It?","Title says it all.  I wrote it like four years ago and ran it for a few months over at /r/stocks.  It was pretty popular but only ran for a few months off my old laptop (/u/stocksbot if you want an idea of what it did)  

(FYI don't mind the post history, some faggot got the account details off my GitHub repository and I haven't bothered logging in and deleting them)

Basically you just type ""$$AAPL"" and it will respond with the stock information from roughly ~15 minutes ago (instant stock data is too rich for my blood).  Now I have way too many servers and need to find a use for them, I thought this would be nice.  It's good for discussions about stocks when you want to make a point by having the relevant information just below your comment.

However; I don't want to revive it if you guys would find it annoying.  I know how annoying a bad/useless bot can be.

I decided to buy into this stock when it was at $6. It quickly grew and peaked (since my buying in) at $7.44 when the earnings report came out. 

They had a pretty rough earnings report and the stock price dropped as a result. However, I believe that this is the perfect opportunity to buy in while its low. 

Firstly, the stock has already started growing back yet again. Secondly, they recently became number one in residential solar in the U.S., passing Tesla's SolarCity. The past two quarters it has passed Tesla in residential sales.

It just announced its expansion into new states, which not only means growth compared to now, but also growth in the future as they continue to expand into more states. It is also good to remember that this was the winter quarter, and it makes perfect sense that solar companies wouldn't do too well in the winter, when the sun is barely out and you can't install in places such as the newly expanded Massachusetts since there is snow on the roofs. Now that we are moving into the spring and summer months, this is the time the company will experience a lot of people installing solar power. 

While Sunrun reported high net loss, they were lower than the previous year as well as almost doubling their net income and increasing their revenue by about $26 million. Since people reacted to the poor earnings report and didn't pay attention to the majority of good news coming out of this company, now is the perfect time to buy into the dip.  Its even been rated as undervalued, for example Credit Suisse set a price target of $15.

I'm running off 39 hours of no sleep and a lot of caffeine, nicotine, and adderall right now, so feel free to chime in about whatever in case I fucked up. And as always, buy $MU and $CRON

EDIT: Forgot to mention that Massachusetts is a meaningful market for them to expand their solar panel and battery business into since it is one of the states with the highest rate of power outages",,832ssm,,0,,false,1522276875,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/832ssm/run_why_you_should_buy_the_dip/,,,,,

Wrote this on another sub and figured I might aswell post it here too to shill my short position. I suggest buying $100-200 2019/20 puts, I think this is a unique opportunity for a huge return. Here is the thing:

Tesla is objectively in very poor financial health, in constrast to what surprisingly many people seem to think. A good way to determine financial health is looking at working capital, which is a company's current assets (cash and liquid assets) minus current liabilities (bills payable within 12 months), if this figure is not positive the company most likely need a cash injection soon.

Tesla's working capital is negative more than a billion. And not only that they are running an operating loss of several hundred million per quarter (money needed just to keep the lights on). Furthermore they have guided for capex of around $4B this year (investments in Model 3 production equipment primarily, also for Gigafactory and other items). Last quarter they pushed out bills for a temporary cash flow boost, but those will then have to be paid this quarter which is also looking like it will be yet another quarterly loss record.

So adding their operating loss and capex spend they will probably have a negative cash flow of at least $1.5B in Q1, which should take them to a negative working capital of a massive $2.5B.

Due to this I very much expected a capital raise either today or tomorrow as they have raised money every time in the past within 14 days of their latest 8-K filing which was filed 12 days ago. Tesla's CAO leaving abruptly at this crucial time with no successor announced does not look good.

If anyone disagrees on the health of Tesla I challenge you to find any other company with a negative working capital as significant as Tesla that is also cash flow negative. That is a very rare financial situation and suggests a significant bankruptcy risk I think many are not aware of.

I had enough losses in 2017 to get a nice return next year as well.,"I was just a regular guy, with a tiny dick that got rock hard on 7% gains a year. I was always mildly autistic but I had learnt to keep it under control and not give in to my autistic tendencies. Although straight, I realized that I might have a budding fascination for penises, which I always suppressed with force. Then one fateful day when I was browsing r/all I came across the final YOLO story of this severely autistic faggot fscomeau. On that day I saw two things that changed my life -    
    

1. I saw this big, shining, veiny, bulbous strap-on dick that was options. Its magnificence fanned my bi-curiosity till it could no longer be suppressed by the winds of ""normality"".    
    

2. When I saw the screeching autistic mass of comments, I felt like my pack was calling me.     
     

I observed the autistic faggotry for a while and the screeching reached a crescendo when the bamboozle was exposed. Meanwhile, In the background there were posts about people doing the fucking with that giant strap-on and obviously posts of people on the other side getting fucked in the ass. Both sides screeching in a gay autistic orgy.    
    

Watching all the action wasn't enough. I wanted in on this orgy, and I finally opened an options trading with about 10k. Coming from years of thinking like a straight guy, I obviously yearned to be the dick that fucks. I first dabbled in tiny dicks with small volume and OTM options or options on stocks with low dollar price (read AMD). I slowly grew hungry for more. I yearned to fuck someone with giant throbbing penis. It was earnings 2017 Q3 season and amazon stock had been flirting with $1000 for quite some time. On the earnings day it breaks out to almost 1050 and falls back right before close. Surely it couldn't go any lower right? So I reach for the big dick and buy an OTM FD worth around 6k (and I hadn't even reached peak autism) and wait for the call. As it turns out, amazon has a huge misses in eps because they reinvested their revenue into expansion. That should be a good thing right? Apparently not, and before I knew it, I was getting fucked hard and fast without any lube by this enormous penis. My ass wasn't ready for it. It hurt. It hurt so bad. But then I came back on here and saw someone with amazon puts cumming so hard that he nearly passed out and the circle continued. It taught me a lesson. I learnt to play with dicks I was comfortable taking up the ass. If you are playing with a big dick, be sure to lube up and take it slowly (thats LEAPS to you autists). By the end of the year I had made back some of the losses.    
I know that some of you faggots actually fuck. And those who fuck hard also have assholes the size of a baseball and can enjoy a good dick from time to time. I will get there too one day.    
In any case, I fondly remembered that pounding yesterday when I was filing my taxes, and I realized I had enough losses in 2017 to write off next year as well. On the bright side I get 800$ more on my tax returns and it soothes my asshole a little. Thanks for the ride guys.

The dilemma for the Fed is to not cause the recession in the process by raising the rates, but rates weren't hiked immediately after the last recession so now we are playing 'catch-up'. 


The Fed will raise rates in March during their next meeting on the 21st, and the fed fund futures calculator shows something like 90% certainty for it as well. [Target rate probabilities](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/)


I am 100% certain rates will be hiked because of these reasons:


* CORE PCE Inflation rate has grown and seems to be going toward their 2% target, sitting at 1.5% now. The fed paused last year in September because PCE was at 1.8% in Feb, 2017 and it dropped down to 1.4% in May. Fed will pause if PCE gaps down to 1.4% or 1.3%


* Jobs report for Feb 2018 shows 313K job creation, this locks in a rate hike in March. Jobs monthly report below 75,000 will trigger a pause.


* Stock market isn't in a correction and we are not in a recession, both are conditions for a pause which are not met. So there will be rate hike.


Source? Jim Rickards, reading Yellen speeches, and analyzing the data. 


How do we profit off this? 


Honestly no clue because there's already strong certainty of rate hike, but I bought vix calls just in case. 


Also interesting, the day after the effective rate hike shows almost 50% increase in volume in major indices.

For reference, I sold Micron at $61 due to a trailing stop%. If you follow the old idiom ""no one ever went broke taking a profit"", you should be looking to take profit as the returns move up the ladder.

The other idiom is ""sell the loser, hold the winners"" but ""sell the losers, trim/take gains on the winners"" works too.

I have a general rule on setting %:

Outset/open new position: Sell all shares at 8% loss

+5% gain: nothing

+10% gain: sell 15% of shares at 7% stop

+15%: sell 25% of shares at 5% stop

+20%: sell 50% of shares at 3% stop

+25%: Cancel all outstanding orders and sell 25% at 3%, 25% at 5%, 50% at 7%.

Ideally you'd want to know the standard deviation of the stock, and set the trailing% at 2 deviations in general (or X% at 2 STD, Y% at 3 STD, all at 4 STD).

If your investment loses some of its value, don’t panic sell. A loss isn’t a loss unless you sell. But also have an exit plan in case things don’t go your way. But make sure you don’t sell for less than what you paid. Got it? You want to sell AND not sell.

Allow me to clear some things up.,"I've seen a lot of talk by people who think they know a thing or two about how TSLA works, but they don't know shit. You can look at the technicals all you want, or the fundementals or whatever. All that shows me is that you're nothing but a baby boy. 

So Tesla has only made 4 cars this year, missing their production target by 100%. *Big Deal*. Oh, was a prepubescent boy was burned alive when the batteries failed? It doesn't matter. Even if their self driving software gets hacked by ISIS and all Tesla cars drive straight for Times Square. No shit off my face. Bears == Lose. None of it matters. Only one thing matters. 

Elon's **MONSTER APE COCK.**

A lot of you pretty boys think you know a thing or two since you look at P/E or Gamma or whatever. Everyone things they have a crystal ball. I don't know what any of those things are. I don't need to. I only need to know one thing. All I need to know is Elon's **WILD RHINO SHLONG**.

Now some of you ugly boys know what I'm talking about - but you don't get the picture yet - ""*bu-bu-but Bezos has a big ol' shlong too!*"". And you're right. And he's got big balls to match that 'Fire Stick' that could just fill you up to the brim with joy.  I'm sure his foreskin has more veins than my varicose grandmothers calves. As soon as his hard, throbbing head hits your prostate, you're in another dimension of bliss.

But here's the difference with Elon. Elon's got a **THORNY SATAN DICK**. It's twisty and turny, and covered in thorns, and you better believe it's gonna hurt when it goes in. When Jeff Bezos fucks you, it's a stretch alright, but it feels good. When Lisa's futa cock goes balls-deep, you feel like the prettiest girl in town. But when Elon's Musk hits you, you scream like a little monkey choir boy. He shreds up your insides like a cheese grater - but people still beg for more. And that's the difference.

Elon could burn the Gigafactory down to the ground, and shit in Ivanka Trump's mouth. It doesn't matter. At the end of the day, thousands will line up to have their hairy assholes torn asunder by his **MEGA ELEPHANT COCK**

#Background
There are only 4 Greeks that you really need to know to trade equity options:

1.	Delta
2.	Gamma
3.	Theta
4.	Vega

If you have at least a modest understanding of these, you’ll be on your way to sweet, sweet tendies in no time. Now onto the gREEEE^EEEEEE^EEks


---


##Delta

Delta is the grand-daddy of them all. The Hugh Heffner of the Greeks. Most of you probably are familiar with delta, because it’s the easiest one. Easier than your sister, which is really saying something.
**Delta represents the relative increase in the price of an option, given an increase in the price of the underlying.** When you buy or sell an option, the price change doesn’t exactly mirror the stock 1:1. Options expire at some point in the future. Stocks don’t expire.

The implication here is that an option is only valuable if you can exercise it for a profit. Logically, this means that deep ITM options will have a delta pretty close to +/-1 (depending on whether it’s a call or a put), while deep OTM options will have a delta pretty close to 0 (or 100/0, whatever convention you use, the only difference is where the decimal is). **Note:** Option deltas range from -1 to 1 (or -100 to 100 deltas). Calls have positive delta (0 to 1) while Puts have negative delta (-1 to 0).

If you’re seeing deltas on your trading platform that are not in this range, you’re probably seeing Dollar Delta, which is just:

Delta x Notional Shares (usually 100 per lot) x Price of Underlying

**Autist’s interpretation:** The easiest way to wrap your autistic brains around this is to think of delta as *roughly* the probability of the underlying stock price going beyond your strike at expiration. For example, an ATM call has around 50 deltas. That means you can intuitively view it as having a 50/50 chance of expiring in the money. An increase in the stock price would give you even greater chances, hence the delta of a slightly ITM call is a little over 50, and deep ITM calls are close to 100 deltas. An ATM Put has roughly -50 deltas. This doesn’t mean a -50% chance of expiring ITM you fucking idiot, it just means that your option value is negatively correlated to price increases.


---



##Gamma

Gamma is the least-hyped Greek out of all of them, but definitely one that could cause your portfolio to turn into a shitshow while you’re not paying attention. **Gamma represents the change in Delta, given a change in the underlying price.**

Gamma is the 2nd order mathematical derivative of price. It tells you how fast your delta will change when price moves happen. Just like speed and acceleration. The second one tells you the rate of change of the first. It can also be interpreted as a measure of convexity, telling you how flat or round something is. Like your flat-chested girlfriend has almost no titty gamma, while Kate Upton titties got gamma for days. Gamma is always positive, and is always largest ATM.

**Autist’s interpretation:** Think of gamma as the big swing when options go from being OTM to ITM or vice versa. So the next time you see that piece of shit stock hitting all time highs, think to yourself “Holy shit, this dumpster fire might actually moon, better YOLO on some calls real quick”, then it drops by $0.05 and your calls drop 50%, blame it on the gamma.


---



##Theta

Theta is the turtle of the greeks. Doesn’t move too fast, doesn’t do too much when you poke it with a stick, boring as fuck. But this is where the time value of options comes from, so it’s important that you know what it is. **Theta is the change in option price, given a 1 day change in time**.

Short option positions have positive theta. Long options positions have negative theta. This means that the marketable value of the  option decays each day it comes closer to the expiration date. Less time to expiry = less time to moon, which means people will pay less for it. This is essentially how options selling strategies make their profits. They bet that the price won’t move that much, and most of the time, they’re actually right, because dumb cucks like you are willing to pay those prices.

Like gamma, theta is also the largest when an option is ATM. As time passes, theta becomes larger and larger. The implication here being that the last week of an option’s life, theta will be exponentially larger.

**Autist’s interpretation:** Think of theta as the shot clock. It keeps ticking away, no matter if the game is exciting or boring. If it’s a really close game (i.e. the option is ATM), then the shot clock is pretty much the make or break thing for you. If the game is a blowout (option is OTM) then it doesn’t really matter that much. When it comes down to the final minute, and it’s make-it-or-break-it for your shitty, shitty, poorly thought out March Madness bracket selections, you’re literally ripping your hair out because you’re on the emotions express, screaming “WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, REF? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?” and then cry and piss yourself in the corner. That’s the only time theta really matters.


---


##Vega

Possibly one of the most misunderstood Greeks, and 105% of the reason behind why RH faggots try to get their trades reversed. **Vega is the change in price of an option for a 1pt increase in the implied volatility of the underlying**.

Now, some of you faggots may know what implied volatility (IV) is, others think you do. No one actually does, because it’s a fucking made up concept in order to get the math to work. The short bus explanation is that implied volatility tells you how much people buying and selling options think that the underlying price has the potential to move in either direction before expiration.

I’m not going to go into how it’s backed out of the Black-Scholes pricing model, or how implied volatility actually represents an estimated annualized 1 standard deviation (68.27%) interval assuming a gaussian distribution of continuous time price movements (specifically addressed to all of you elitist NERDS out there, cash me in the comments, howbow dah?).

Implied volatility is the only unobservable and incalculable input to an option’s price. It’s literally made up. Historically, it hangs out somewhere between 5-10% above historical realized volatility, but when or why it jumps or drops is purely based on the dumb cucks who are trading the options.

The important distinction here is that **Implied Volatility tells you whether an option is relatively expensive or relatively cheap. Vega does not.** Vega just tells you how sensitive an option’s price is to changes in the will of the people.

Both calls and puts have positive vega. Intuitively, this means that when people think the market will move sharply in either direction, options increase in value, because people want protection (or phat gainz).

**Autist’s interpretation:** Vega tells you how much you’re fucked when people lose interest in a hot meme stock after it doesn’t moon, or when people unwad their fucking panties after some good ‘ol Thursday action.

Hopefully you retards made it this far without wandering off to try and hump a doorknob. If so, congratulations, I hereby award you 10 good boy points. If there’s enough interest, and I can find more whiskey, I might do a part 2 on basic options strategies and how to completely misapply them.

I didn't have a worry in the world, and neither did anyone else, as every Joe the Plumber could get a jumbo mortgage and buy his dream $700k home in las vegas with an adjustable rate NINJA mortgage. 

One of my college buddies took a family trip to cancun that summer. He was like 5'8, balding but otherwise hairy, with a medium build. He managed to get seduced by a (as described by him) 230lb behemoth who took him back to her place for some good ol unprotected sex a few of the nights.

Anyway - she worked at Goldman. During pillow talk one night, she mentioned that he should stay away from investing in Bear Stearns - they wouldn't be around for much longer. 

He relayed that onto me because he knew i was a budding investing autist. I scoffed at it (but had no money to invest anyway). At that point, Bear was $140 a share and a wall street titan. Even as the first signs of the financial crisis began to pop up, it seemed silly that Bear would be impacted to a greater degree than anyone else - and surely they'd never go bankrupt. 

Fast forward to the spring of 2008 and bear basically went bankrupt and got sold to JPM for the pity price of $10/share. 

So what's that got to do with anything (other than maybe it's a good idea to fuck a fat chick on vacation to get insider info)?

Clearly there's a crisis of confidence regarding TSLA. Shares are down $100 (30%) in less than a month. Bond prices have fallen off a cliff and yields have risen. TSLA is pretty much structurally bankrupt (and always has been) and the stock price was always based on elon's cokedreams, but it seems as though the smart money has had enough of elon's shit. 

Soon, M3 depositors will ask for money back, suppliers will ask for better terms (up to potential up-front payment), and cash will dry up. Solar City is a moneyhole that TSLA has to keep funding. TSLA has already securitized and sold off pretty much anything it can (solar city / tesla future revenue streams). TSLA already played the AP game last quarter in order to generate cash flow - can't do that again. They can't really tap the debt market any more with the current bond prices implying that any further raise would happen at 8%+ interest rates. They maybe can still sell a little equity, but that will only further show that the jig is up.

So follow the smart money that's already been selling stock and bonds and get the fuck out of TSLA (and buy puts). maybe not today - there's some chance elon pulls a rabbit out of his hat regarding Q1 M3 deliveries and there's a bit of a relief rally and shares retrace towards $300. But the M3's being produced right now are shit - all over the internet there are pictures of people being asked to take delivery of cars that wouldn't pass a Kia quality control inspection. There will be endless replacements and warranty claims until TSLA just gives up and rolls over.

I'd expect to see TSLA below $200 within a month, below $100 within 6 months, and perhaps in restructuring talks within a year.

Bloomberg's production model projects 2k M3s per week within 2 weeks.

So sure, this isn't 2500 per week by end of March. 2k per week at $45k per car is still over $1 billion more revenue per quarter than they made last year. If you look at the week over week increase in Bloomberg's production model, the production rate is growing exponentially. And accelerating faster since the line shutdown in February for equipment upgrades.

They might not be at 2500/week, but they're pretty close and I'm betting the farm that they'll meet or exceed 5k by end of Q2. This selloff is a huge opportunity.

A change of plans moving forward.,"I ain't masturbated yet you sick fucks. I am currently on my 7th days of no orgasm but the lack of proof I can provide to you is simply not okay in my book, so I am going to change things up a little.

I will purchase a chastity cage, specifically this one: (https://www.amazon.com/Utimi-Cock-Chastity-Device-Locked/dp/B075MCMM6N?ref_=fspcr_pl_dp_1_1243841011)

I like this cage because it offers variation in ring size so I can adjust accordingly to fit my magnum(ish) dong, as well as the ability to piss effectively, an actual feature listed on the website.

Now here is the important part: I will NOT, under ANY circumstance mail the key to a mod: too much risk. What if they lose the key? What if it gets lost en route to the mod? I don't wanna fuck with that shit.

HOWEVER, I will place the key inside a Piggy-Bank Like device. During every livestream I intend to do I will destroy the Piggy Bank like device and recover the key, to show that I have not used it in between livestreams. I may use an actual piggy bank, or a sealed envelope, whichever serves the function of proof I have not massaged my penis with my hands.


I am moving out of my current house right now, so I am extra busy and unable to do any livestreams this week; but next week is when I will have gained back more free time, therefore I will be able to show you degenerate fucks how I am dedicated to this NoFap challenge. I said I would do this, so I hope the level of proof I provide will be enough.

Thank you for tuning in.

In a set of internal memos, the heads of engineering and production at Tesla are trying to ramp up production for Model 3s to exceed 300 cars a day in order to show up the ""haters."" According to them, this would be a big win and make shorts regret betting against them. It does not confirm if they have even reached 300 models produced per day.

In reality, this confirms predictions that Tesla will miss promised production targets, again. Tesla promised to increase model production rates to 2500 cars per week.  With some simple math, assuming the factory operates 7 days week producing 300 cars per day, that's only 2100 per week. Tesla's promises to improve production have allowed them to secure more capital. This does not help their situation, as they are recalling the Model S. If they miss big again, lines or credit and access to capital markets will be limited.

1522196993,wallstreetbets,CudderKid,self.wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/87nn06/on_dd_little_talked_about_semiconductor_company/,0,0,,,$ON DD - Little talked about semiconductor company,"Welcome to Know What You’re Invested in Edition 2: Last week’s topic was MEME stocks and the subject was JD.com; the thread can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/84yc7t/know_what_youre_invested_in_edition_1_jdcom/



This week’s topic is Semiconductors – and the subject will be ON Semiconductor ($ON)
Credibility Tracker: $JD is subsequently down ~4%, but OP’s recommendation was shares or LEAPS (specifically September $45s), we’ll mark this as neutral trending negative but with a negligible time lapse thus and non-company related events being the main cause of price decline.  


What: ON Semiconductor manufactures and sells semiconductors and discrete power management devices through three divisions, Image Sensors, Power Solutions and Analog Solutions. ON’s flagship semis are powerful in several key areas, image sensory, proximity sensory, image signal processing, autofocus capabilities, and image stabilization and all ON products are top of class in energy efficiency in the Semi market.


Why: As you read in the above, ON’s strengths are in image processing and energy efficiency. Let’s take a look at ON’s Revenue by Market for 2017:


Automotive – 32%


Industrial/Aero-defense/Medical – 26%


Communications – 19%


Computing – 10%

Consumer (Other) – 13%


Hopefully by now you’ve put 1 and 1 together to realize gainz. Image processing and energy efficiency are the leading demand of customers in 58% of ON’s revenue-generating markets, which also happen to be growth markets. With continued focus on self-driving automobiles and electric/hybrid powered cars ramping up, demand for image processing, proximity sensors and power management devices should increase substantially. Similarly growing demand will be placed on image processing chips in medical devices as healthcare ramps up for the boomer last stages of life; image recognition, proximity sensory and image stabilization devices will be used heavily to automate poor people’s jobs due to manufacturing 4.0 and a Republican government means aero-defense spending, Hashtag America First. For all my meme lovers out there – this can be an effective hedge as none of these products would be affected by a downturn in crypto-mining or Cramer-caused memory “cycles.”


Advancements in USB and mini USB conductors for notebooks, laptops, chargers, cell phones and Bluetooth devices continue to help ONs growth in the secondary markets it serves (communications and computing). Combining all of these, ON presented an expansion of IoT embedded offerings that are extremely promising, including automotive connectivity ( + wireless charging), image sensing  chips for both automotive use and surveillance (hellllooooo facebook!) and new ARM cortex low power RF SOC’s for all purpose IIOT.


ON recently announced a key Partnership with Silicon Valley’s Plug &amp; Play innovation leader on two major platforms, Mobility and IoT. ON’s node to cloud environment is strategically poised to continue to deliver solutions to automotive electrical systems, self-driving applications, factory automation and machine vision.

 
Investor Snapshot:

Market Cap - $11.1B

Institutional Ownership – 94%

Short Interest – 4.5%

Forward P/E – 15.08

P/E Growth – 2.13

Financial Improvements:

Over the past 3 years $ON has made a lot of headway in improving its financial position. Q4 EPS from 2015-2017 have risen to .19-.29-.39 Q/Q/Q, and while revenue has a similar uptrend, the increase is not as drastic, $800M-$1.3M-$1.4M respectively. This is due to  $ON paying off ~$1B in debt during 2017 and efficiently managing cashflow (cash from operations doubled from 16-17, ratio up 33% from Q4 2015 – Q4 2017).

Disclaimer: OP is taking today’s 4.44% dip to add SHARES and LEAPS and is not playing any short term catalyst or short-term leveraged positions. Semi’s got killed today, as did everything. Semis involved in self-driving technology got hit the hardest. This is non-company related dip and an entry point that I am taking advantage of. Previously, no position, at close OP purchased ON 07/20/2018 26.00 C  for 1.90/each.

Also a weak dollar and strong euro makes buying stocks cheap for eurofags right now.

Facebook in my opinion will be just fine because nobody with a social life is going to delete it, especially not Instagram or Whatsapp, ad revenue is still going to grow, which is the only key factor.

Google has been flat for almost a year which is ridiculous because of record revenue last year. I think YouTube will continue to grow, Android is going to be fine even if they have to pay Oracle. What I fear is a lot of competition from Alexa and Siri regarding their core Search Engine Advertising, how many nerds are still out there with a classic computer in 10 years?

Now to my biggest overrated love, Tesla. I really want them to succeed and I believe electric cars will be huge in 5 years. However I think the classic old giants like VW are not in the worst position when they leave the battery manufacturing to the chinese  and do what they do best, assemble and do classic marketing. They sold more than 10 million cars last year even though they had dieselgate... Tesla has to get their alien dreadnought manufacturing going and autonomous driving has to advance, right now I am sceptical, but believing that Elon and his crew are 10 times smarter than the rest I want to believe.

Anyway those are my thoughts, feel free to share your autism.

Also, I think the whole market is going to correct drastically in the next two years when trump has to go and the mess that's left behind has to be cleaned up.

I am apparently the only buyer today as the 15 volume so far were mine. optionsprofitcalculator cant even calculate the calls right now for some reason idk. The return on it is astronomical, true moon shot boys, just need to rally next week for the easiest 10x Ive seen.

Let me know if Im horribly mistaken and just threw 500$ into a blender. 

Edit:
To all the re-used Robinhood hate...why pay for commission on options? I have an E*TRADE account too but $7.70 every move is wasted. 

Just use finviz for fundamental and technical analysis, and Robinhood as the broker. Why spend the extra money?

Edit 2: 
So I use my own calculator that I made in excel to model the call prices. It is kind of limited and only works on one contract at a time (and it uses the actual dollar value, so 30$ instead of 0.3(x100) ).

I see today that they have gained 12%, and 28.9% since Mar 23.

Revenue, Gross Profit have been declining and Net Income is in the negatives and increasing. Sales are down as well.

This company is fucked, and this looks like a bit of an opportunity to me. Can someone that actually knows what they're doing tell me why I'm wrong? 

It looks like any profits they do post are going to be due to the new tax regulations, the sell-off of all their assets (thus reducing expenses), and any profits will be unsustainable as they no longer have the infrastructure to make future sales. They are focusing on smaller stores.

They have a deal with Amazon to sell kenmore appliances.

This all seems very short term to me and I am considering buying Put's on this for a few months out.

Now, in an effort to restore the sub to its former glory I would like to start a discussion before wildly swinging the ban hammer. While ban hammers are fun, they aren’t very effective. 

REMINDER OF RULES

* No promotion of any newsletter / education service for profit / referral or affiliate links. (May result in permeate ban)
* No discussion of penny stocks or OTC
* Do be responsible giving and taking advice.
* Do have discussions that relate to trading.
* Don't try to talk about what you don't know.
* Don't post your paper trades / RH &lt; 20k
* Don't make posts asking for a trade, IE submissions that boil down to ""&lt;ticker&gt;?"" or ""What do with $?""
* Don’t ask how options or another financial instrument works, do your own research. 
* Post asking about what you think and leading to a discussion.

REMINDER OF THE UNSPOKEN RULES

* Most of us don’t enjoy crypto. Crypto has its own sub.
* Please make high quality shit posts.
* As fellow mod u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY said, “I've been getting tired of people saying ""tendies"" and ""cucks"" and all that sort of 4chan and the_donald shit. We're wallstreet fucking bets. We have 230k subscribers. We have our OWN memes, our OWN lingo. There's no reason we should be getting sloppy ass, secondhand, shit-tier lingo like ""tendies"" and ""cucks"".
* Please don’t cross post memes and lingo. We are WS FUCKING B. (Personally, I like tendies but reuse a meme to many times and we just about killed it.
* Don’t post solely political content looking to get a rise from a random internet stranger.
* Don’t post questions that you can easily google.  

FUTURE OF WSB

* Personally, I’d love to have a paper trading competition that restarts every quarter. (Possibly on market watch.)
* Please comment some things you would like to see from the community, and the mods.

POSTS THAT I WILL BE REMOVING

* I will be doing my best to moderate this sub but I need community support. Please use the flair when applicable, as well as report posts that neglect the rules and guide lines. Reporting posts will make it much easier to find garbage posts. I will do my best to remove low quality shit posts. 

* Ps. For the love of god please put just slightly more effort into the shit posts. 
* Ps. Ps. Invite your girl to our discord, I’ve never heard a single female talk and its getting dry.

Sometimes they raise equity (and the stock price inexplicably goes up), sometimes they raise debt, and sometimes they take unsecured, $1000 deposits on cars that will certainly not be delivered on time. With Moody's downgrading their debt to junk status, and wall st currently taking a bloody dump all over their stock, insolvency may soon become a real issue. So here are my thoughts: forward month $50 strike puts are about $.04. $100 gets you 25 which would probably be worth around $100k if tesla filed.

Resulted in LFIN share price increasing &gt;1200% and market cap increasing by over $2 billion. That company will earn $3 million this year. Buy puts.

LongFin is a “global” fintech company that operates out of a WeWork shared office space for fledgling entrepreneurs. According to LongFin, their business model consists of:
#
-  [Importer/Exporter Financing] (https://youtu.be/LnIKiNAupRs?t=46s)
-  Electronic Market Making 
-  Blockchain powered Smart Contract Solutions
-  Financial Institution Intermediation
-  Blockchain powered Treasury Management Engine
	
Their website greets you with a convoluted mess of buzzwords, stock images, and “market size” numbers. This quote on their homepage attempts to summarise their clusterfuck of a business model:
&gt;**Reimagining the world of Alternative Finance (Shadow Banking), $72 trillion industry powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Blockchain enabled Smart Contracts.**

This is probably starting to get confusing, so to make it worse, [here is a video of the CEO attempting to explain what it is that his company does](https://youtu.be/31eI-O1ZW1E). During these ten minutes, LFIN share price dropped 16%.

“Fughazi” you are saying, “What’s this about Blockchain I hear?” Alas, we need to go further down the rabbit hole.

To truly grasp just how terrible this company is, let’s start from before it went public and associated itself with Blockchain. Although little information is available, LongFin has published its [unaudited financials going back to 2014](https://www.longfincorp.com/financials.html) on its website.
#
- The 2016 fiscal year yielded $40 million in revenue and $7 million net profit.
- The 2017 fiscal year yielded $28 million in revenue and $1.8 million net profit.

On December 13, 2017, LFIN was listed on the Nasdaq at a valuation of $382.5 million. For a company that owns nothing proprietary and relies on buzzwords to fill a page, valuing it at over 13 times current revenue was brave to say the least.

The stock price remained at around $5 until a few days after the IPO, when Longfin announced the acquisition of [Ziddu.com](https://ziddu.com/), a ***blockchain*** microfinance startup. This catapulted the already inflated share price of $5 to $72 in under a week. 

Before Ziddu's acquisition, Longfin had a market cap of around $400M. Today, Longfin’s market cap is $2.62 billion. This suggests that Ziddu carries over $2 billion in value for Longfin’s share price. 

So what? Maybe they were shopping around at the right time and found this diamond in the rough that would grow their business exponentially, right? Not quite. An SEC filing from 12/11/17 reveals that Longfin purchased Ziddu from Meridian Enterprises, ***which is 95% owned by Longfin CEO, Venkat Meenavalli***. That’s right, this dude increased the value of his company over 1200% by playing an autistic game of hot potato with himself using Ziddu. If you want to congratulate them, the CFO’s personal cell is on Longfin’s SEC filings. Even better, the CEO himself said that Ziddu will earn Longfin [***around $3 million***](https://youtu.be/31eI-O1ZW1E?t=6m26s) in the next year. 

Everything accounted for, you may be wondering why I am so in favor of a short position now of all times. Here’s why: Longfin will be having its first earnings report as a publicly listed company on April 8th. Although this itself would not be very important, this will be its first earnings report with Ziddu.com as its subsidiary. 

If we’re extremely generous and assume that the IPO valuation was accurate and the  $100 million purchase price of Ziduu is fair, that would realistically value the company at just under $7 per share. At this point, even the CEO acknowledges that the extremely low float (~1 million shares) is the only thing keeping this ridiculous pump going. The float will tear down the share price just as easily as it brought it up.

So how do you cash in on this shitstain of a company? Well, if you suck off your broker, you might be able to secure a short position, but where’s the leverage in that anyways? This happens to be one of the first Blockchain pump &amp; dumps with options, so I just went ahead and loaded up on puts. First set is April 20 expiration at a strike of $40 to play that earnings dump, and then some June 15 at a strike of $25 to get the rest of that downside.

***EDIT***
#Credit to u/etzel1200 for this theory:

#***RED FLAG #1***

""This is something I'd really like to get people's thoughts on.

I think it's pretty undeniable the company is either blatantly fraudulent or not too great on its merits at best. However, potential legal issues aside, is the below possible?

The company has an extremely small float. While its valued in the billions, the float is much, much smaller.

Possible plan:

1) IPO with tiny float.

2) Start spouting about crypto.

3) Have related parties buy shares to spike the price.

4) Others start shorting/buying puts due to the obvious ridiculousness

5) Make money selling puts and making a small number of shares available to short for the lending fees.

5) Maintain a price floor by buying all available shares at some price, say $50 per. Because of the small float, this is doable.

6) The company doesn't even need to make money. The company could be paid for 'consulting' services to offset whatever the small burn rate from having a few WeWork desks is.

7) Given the price of puts, this could be profitable and kept up indefinitely.

Starting next year the departed CFO can sell 50k or so shares a month. At some point the buyer of those convertible notes will presumably want to convert them to equity and sell.

However, until then or when the SEC comes a knocking, what really prevents the above? Could that be what is happening?""

#***RED FLAG #2***
Stampede Capital owns about 36% of LFIN. It trades in India with a market value of 220 crore rupees. About $34 million USD.

*This means Indian markets are essentially valuing Longfin at $100 million while U.S. markets are holding it at a valuation of $3 billion. Any remotely rational market would arbitrage that in a heartbeat.*

After completing my first several tens of options trades through Etrade, I grew tired of paying hundreds of dollars in commissions just so that I could lose my money. I watched all of my friends surpass me, getting ""free options trades"" from a broker called Robinhood. Now, I've heard of this broker, in fact I began my investment career trading stocks with them until I discovered just how lucrative options can't be, at which point I emptied my account and moved to Etrade. I put myself on the list for options in January and it said ""you are #243,000 in line.""

Fuck that, time to open a tastyworks account.

Another friend rubbed it into me that he had just gotten options in Robinhood and I felt sick. After being such a model customer, formerly making modest 7-9% losses per month and now with a $0.00 account balance, why wasn't I allowed to trade options? I opened up Robinhood and checked my place in the line. 603,751. I knew something was broken. 

As a last ditch effort, I deposited my last $100 into my account and asked myself what else I could do. Opened up their investment profile tab and immediately saw the problem. ""Risk tolerance: low. Trading experience: not much. Place on the autism spectrum: not applicable."" Time to make a change. I made my couple adjustments making myself appear much wealthier, much less risk averse, and prayed to our Lord Martin. It worked, I woke up this morning, a mere 8 hours later to a notification saying I was approved for options. Frienss, follow my steps and you will be guaranteed free options trades for the rest of your sorry lives. 

See you all at the food depot later this year.

&gt;WASHINGTON—The Trump administration’s anti-China tariffs could hit $50 billion of Chinese imports, said an individual with knowledge of the plans.President Donald Trump is scheduled to make an announcement at 12:30 p.m. on tariffs and investment restrictions aimed at China designed to get Beijing to halt practices the U.S. believes violate U.S. intellectual property rights.The U.S. is also expected to announce it would sue China at the World Trade Organization for trade law violations. The tariffs would be assessed separtely without going to the WTO.Trump officials had earlier said that the tariffs would apply to about $30 billion in Chinese imports. An accompanying report on Chinese trade practices is expected to estimate that the harm to the U.S. from improper technology transfer to Chinese firms is $30 billion annually. Beijing improperly forces U.S. firms to transfer their technology to Chinese joint venture partners as a requirement to do business in that nation, the U.S. trade officials allege.It’s not clear why the administration appears to have settled on a larger number. On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. was using a computer algorithm it developed to decide which products to target. The U.S. is looking to restrict imports of goods that would harm Beijing, but cause relatively little harm to U.S. consumers and companies.



China's response has been to target US agriculture, 

&gt;China is preparing to hit back at trade offensives from Washington with tariffs aimed at President Donald Trump’s support base, including levies targeting U.S. agricultural exports from Farm Belt states, according to people familiar with the matter.
The plans are part of a strategy that has taken shape in recent weeks as Beijing seeks to avert tariffs by warning of possible repercussions and offering incentives to the U.S., including better access to China’s markets, especially in the financial sector.
China’s President Xi Jinping has taken this carrot-and-stick approach in an effort to avoid a trade war, these people said.
“Any Chinese response to new U.S. tariffs would be measured and proportional,” said a Chinese official involved in policy-making.
The White House plans to announce punitive measures against China on Thursday, including tariffs on at least $30 billion in imports. Those are in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs taking effect Friday.
In response, China is likely to target U.S. exports of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. is among the top suppliers of these products to China, which imports around a third of soybeans that the U.S. produces, data from the two countries show.
How would this negatively effect US tech firms when the tariffs are supposed to work in favor of US tech sector? 

Is there something I'm missing here? or is it just weak hands?

So I got sick of losing money this past week, and thought I’d finally give FDs a try. Saw SPY breaking down below 266, then below intraday low of 265.4. Waited too long and bought (200) Mar 23rd 260 puts for 0.29. Dead cat bounce happened, freaked out and sold at 0.31 and watched the contracts drop to 0.2 and thought it was a great decision. Shortly after watched the contracts jump to 0.7 a piece, would’ve been able to sell my 200 contracts at 14,000 when I paid 5800, and net profit would have been: $8200. Instead, since TDA charges me no flat fee and $1.50/contract fee, I ended up paying $600 in commission on a $400 profit trade so I lost $200. Never buying FDs again.

Looking back, January might have been the top. Tax bill got passed, no worries about tariffs or trade war, no worries about Powell and his interest rate schedule. It was a market full of optimism. And honestly, I think we’ve may have double peaked two weeks ago when the SPY hit 280.

But don’t worry, if we do solidly break the 200 day, dont panic. The market will surely want to rekiss the 200 day, and when it does, I’m personally gonna sell everything and go short.
