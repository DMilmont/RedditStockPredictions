[Ref. original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88injx/us_economic_results_4218_4618/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

**Non-farm payrolls**

Forecast: 198.0

Predicted (i.e. what I predicted): 178.6

Actual: 103.0

Predicted a miss. Got a miss.

**Unemployment rate**

Forecast: 4.0

Predicted: 4.0

Actual: 4.1

Predicted a meet. Did not get this one.

**Average hourly earnings**

Forecast: 0.3%

Predicted: 0.2%

Actual: 0.3%

0.3% was actually my first choice (ref. [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/89yeu7/recap_day_3_of_us_economic_results_forecasts_2nd/dwvatlp/)), but I don't want to do these things with guesswork (the idea being that people should be able to replicate my work and verify my calcs themselves), and it failed.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Red

Results: FIVE OUTTA FIVE BAYBEE :-/

I haven't looked at next week's schedule, but if I'm not mistaken, it should be a relatively slow week. However, be aware that a number of external factors have just whipped out their dicks, and are slowly stroking them, building anticipation for the moment they grab us by the hips, flip us over, and claim what's theirs.

* Tariffs. These will not go away. China is only the first country to counter our tariffs. Wait until other countries realize they can exact massive pain on us by levying their own. You guys know Mexico, right? Well, they just told Trump to quit being a dick or they'll stop collaborating. In other words, they're telling us to stop fucking with them or they're going to fuck with us right back. Trump doesn't want a wall to keep people out. He wants one to make sure he still has a cheap labor supply for his fucking golf courses.

* We just got our first hint of the subprime auto loan bubble collapsing. Several smaller lenders have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the last month. What changed in the last month? I can't boil it down to a simple answer, but the short of it is: turns out that, on average, people still can't afford to buy things, and the default rate is starting to weigh down the industry. And if you think they've hedged appropriately, you're the type of idiot who'd get a subprime loan in the first place.

""I'm concerned that we may not be able to attribute dips to overreactions anymore,"" is a complete fucking understatement. **STAY AWAY FROM WEEKLIES** and start shifting a portion of your portfolio to cash if more shit-meets-fan cues manifest. Don't forget to stay hydrated, too.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

N/A


**ANYTHING ELSE?**

To reiterate the way I do shit: I buy puts when the market goes up, and calls when it goes down. This strategy is fine if you stay the fuck away from weeklies, and don't mind being in the red for 1+ week(s). And don't bet against $TSLA.

Look for next week's predictions sometime tomorrow or Sunday.

Since most of you are casuals and probably on Robhinhood, I thought it would be fun to write up a thread on some plays I’ve been thinking about for the month of April. I’m also drinking alone at home, so why not. These plays are risky. If you lose, you **will** lose over half (or all) of your initial “investment”. If you win, you could make a lot more. 

All prices I use will be the middle point between today’s closing bid-ask spread. Come Monday morning, these prices and values may be wildly different, but the theory behind my reasoning will be the same (assuming underlying share price stays around the same). I also may or may not already have positions open for some of these plays. I promise you I’m not trying to pump options prices or sell you overpriced calls. None of these plays will be on penny stocks or low volume companies, so I can’t move their share price. If I had that kind of clout, I wouldn’t be typing up stuff on this retarded subreddit. 

These plays will also be simple. No spreads or exotic options plays. I might save that for another thread if this takes off.

**Wells Fargo ($WFC)**
-

The play that comes right after this one is objectively better in almost every way, but I’m putting this play first because it’ll give you some insight into my theories. 

Wells Fargo and other banks (bar JPM) have been struggling really hard this year. Wells Fargo has been struggling the most. I consider this pick to be a badly cut diamond in a pile of other, slightly worse, badly cut diamonds. But here’s the thing with badly cut diamonds like WFC: they have really cheap premiums. Their premiums are low because investors expect these companies to do poorly (because of recent performance), have low volatility (because of their generally stable nature), and/or are simply overlooked. 

WFC has not been stable this year. It’s down over 20% from its highest point this year ($66/share), which is a lot for a largely stable company, let alone a large financial company like WFC. Despite its downward trend, WFC has not fallen below $52 very often. Even during today’s huge red day, and other red days alike, WFC had a hard time staying below $52. This makes me believe that it has reached its bottom and that investor sentiment cannot realistically drop lower until we have more material information. 

WFC’s earnings report is on April 13th. When I see companies like these, where share price has tanked but then refuses to tank any further on horribly red days, I see a potential buying opportunity. Call prices are usually low, implied volatility is low, and investor sentiment is rock bottom. That means that even average news can increase share price. Above average news can send it flying. This news is coming up very soon and is a gambling opportunity in my book. Note that this is a *gamble*. You will most likely lose 100%, so put in only what you’re comfortable losing. 

* **April 13th 52.50 Calls**

These calls are stupidly cheap for an earnings play on a recently volatile company. An increase of 2.3% in the underlying makes this call profitable. WFC *today* dropped almost 2%. [Edit: To elaborate on this point, a reversal of Friday’s drop would alone make this play profitable. And on top of that, these calls would still be priced for the earnings report coming up later that week.] Personally, I think investors have overlooked this company, and its options, far too much. I think that average news will increase WFC’s share price to $54/share, which is an around 3% increase from today’s closing price. Anything more is great, but I’m banking on average and hoping for more. I’m also hoping for an increase in share price next week before earnings. The play here is to buy April 13th 52.50 calls. 

If share price goes up to $54, these calls will **profit 56%** (again, using prices derived from today’s closing bid-ask spread). If share price goes up to $55, these calls will **profit 160%**. If share price goes up to $65, near its highest price from this year, these calls will **profit 1200%** (unlikey to happen).

**Financials ETF ($XLF)**
-

I was debating on whether to share this pick in this thread or not because I haven’t bought calls yet myself. But then I thought, who in the hell with enough money to pump up prices on an ETF this large would also listen to my advice? Anyway, this play is a variation of the play I shared above with WFC, but better (less upside, though with much greater chance for success). This ETF is impregnated by Warren Buffett, and other financial companies and banks.

The premium on these calls is ridiculously low. They’re low because 1. this is an ETF filled with very stable companies, so it’s doubly stable; and 2. sentiment among financials this year has been lackluster. But with earnings season kicking off on April 13th with banks, I expect this ETF to be extra volatile. It’s not priced for volatility because investors don’t think this earnings season will start off with a bang, but I think it will because I’m smarter than those fucks. 

* **September 21st 30.00 calls**

This play isn’t all-or-nothing. In fact, even if the play goes south, there will still be plenty of premium left in it for some semblance of recovery. But the point isn’t to baghold. What you should be doing is selling these calls come April 13th no matter what happens — unless you believe trade war fears will die down and the entire market will recover. This play *does* leave that avenue open to you. Still, don’t do it. Just get rid of it and move on. 

If the underlying goes to $28/share (~3% increase), these calls will **profit ~50%**. If the underlying goes to $29/share (~6.7% increase), these calls will **profit ~140%**. If the underying goes to where it was before trade war fears came up ($30/share), these calls will **profit ~220%**. 

The above values are rough estimates of what you could realistically see. They’re conservative estimates and on the lower end, so you don’t feel like I jipped you if share price goes up and calls aren’t as profitable as I advertised. 

-

-

**Amazon ($AMZN)**
-

* **April 13th 1500 calls**

The timing for this play has most likely already passed if Monday opens green. It’s also incredibly risky. It depends on a single green day early in the week, and if that green day doesn’t come, it’s over. I only put $2000 into these calls today at closing because the likelihood of this succeeding is basically nothing. 

We all know Trump hates Amazon. Share price dropped from almost $1600 to $1400 with Trump’s tweets coupled with trade war fears. However, $50 swings in this company’s share price are not uncommon. In fact, this thing had a $100 swing just this week, in less than 2 full trading days, before today’s tariff announcement. 

All I need is for share price to go back up to $1450 before Wednesday mid-day. If it does, these calls will **profit ~300%**. If share price goes up to $1475, these calls will **profit ~600%**. If there’s another $100 swing up to $1500, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

The above estimates are, again, a bit on the low end. Timing also matters a lot here. A 300% profit one day may only be 100% the next (with the same change in underlying).

**EXPLANATIONS:**

* Methodology: Avg.  of last 6 months actual results * [1 + (YoY simple growth rate / 12)] -- simplistic, sure, but probably still better than the non-farm forecasters.

* Source: [worldeconomiccalendar.com](http://worldeconomiccalendar.com/)

* I'm only planning to do forecasts for the reports that have a ""three bull"" rating. I also **WILL NOT** forecast crude oil inventories because it's a fucking pain in the ass. If you can't live without a forecast for crude oil, just look at what happened over the last few weeks, count how many times it beat v. missed, and expect the trend to follow whichever there's more of (although you should also consider things like weather, prices at the pumps, and so on).

* ""Red,"" ""Boring,"" ""Green,"" are just for fun. I try to base them on real information, but don't get it twisted: THEY'RE GUESSES. If anything, I'm hoping people will take them as a springboard for discussion, since we really do need more real-talk.

    Red = bad

    Boring = markets are dancing around each other like those bitches in West Side Story

    Green = /u/MrTrader1's mom's dick

**WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT WEEK?**

4/9/18: Boring

4/10/18: Green

4/11/18: Green

4/12/18: Red

4/13/18: Boring

Guesses will be revised if/when news requires it. I don't factor Trump into my initial set, but as the week wears on, I do account for his dumbass shenanigans in my commentary and make revisions if needed.

Now what do you do? Here is a list of things you can do.


1. Nothing. Yup that is the first thing you could do. You could just wait and hope that the stock goes back up.

2. Panic Sell. All you do is hit the sell button and realize your loses. Great if you need a tax break.

3. Tax loss harvest. Similar to number 2, works great for ETFs, kinda hard to do for equities. So suppose you bought the S&amp;P 500 right at the top and it drops. All you do sell the ETF for a loss and buy something similar. For example, you could sub out SPY for QQQ (another example is swapping MU for AMAT) and once 30 days has passed, you can go back to opening SPY and successfully harvest losses. Note that the ETF that you swap it out for must not be ""substantially identical,"" aka you can't sub SPY for VOO (since both of them track the S&amp;P 500).

4. Double down/average down. As the name implies, as the price goes down, you buy more. You should only do this if you are still bullish.

5. Selling covered calls + Double down. (If you are bearish in the short term but bullish in the long term)

Note this requires a Level 1 Options. If you can't get approved for a level 1 options account, then you are a true faggot. Here is how to this strategy. Buy more shares so that your total amount of shares is a multiple of 100. For example if you have 48 shares of NVDA, then you go out and buy 52 more shares. Next you go out and sell some OTM covered calls. Selling calls with a week or two works best for this in order to maximize Theta decay.

6. Selling naked calls. Note you have to have naked calls from your broker and you also need a margin account. Basically is the same thing as above except instead of buying 52 more shares of NVDA, you just selling a call. Don't get too greedy with this. If the share shoots up, you will get cucked.

7. Buy a put. Pretty self explanatory.

8. Collars. Can be combined with 6 in order to cap losses. For every 100 shares you own, you sell an OTM call and buy an OTM put. Works great if you want to protect yourself from an unexpected to drop in price but also don't want to pay for an OTM put. Recommended expiration date (1-2 years).

9. Stock repair strategy. (Requires options and a margin account). Suppose you don't want to commit any more money to a trade and all you want to do at this point is just break even. Here is what you can do, buy a ATM call and sell two OTM calls. The price of the ATM or close to ATM call should be equal to the price of the two OTM calls or as close to equal. This way you don't have to commit any more capital to the trade. Recommended expiration date is 1-2 months out.

Here is a example.

Suppose you bought Facebook right before the Cambridge Analytica thing. Let's say you bought 1000 shares @ 172.5. Now it is March 23, and well you are down around $13k. What you can do this buy 10 $162.5 calls (May 4th) for $1.20 and sell 20 172.5 calls @ $0.6 (Try to get your debit/credit under 5 cents, just put an offer and eventually it will get filled). The goal of this strategy is to lower your cost basis in exchange for profit potential.
 Now there are three cases.
1. Facebook tanks even more. In this case you collect that 0.05 Premium per share (since we have a credit). Please note that you shouldn't try to maximize credit for this strategy.

2. Facebook recovers a little bit to $160, you net even on expiration date since your call that you bought will expire worthless and the two calls you sold will expire worthless. Watch your trades however since sometimes if it recovers a little bit, you can close you your trade for a profit. 

3. Facebook expires between $162.50 and $172.50, this is the best result as your $162.50 will expire profitable and the two $172.50 calls will expire worthless.

4. Facebook gaps up past $172.50, you will still end up profitable at the end since you own the underlying, however in this situation you would have made more money not using this strategy. 


Please do a quick Google search before attempting any of the strategies that involve options if you don't know what you are doing.


FAQ


Q: Can I do the stock repair strategy for options? 

A: No, you can't buy an option for an option unless if you have an ISDA. If you don't know what an ISDA is, fuck off and go watch The Big Short. Even if you do have an ISDA, calls-on-calls are very illiquid assets.

If there was anything unclear or you have questions, please ask below.

Questions:


From /u/adonisbosq
When buying a put, should I buy ATM put or slightly OTM for around two months? or around how long?

Where you choose to ATM or an OTM put is honestly up to you. As for the strike price, I would select an expiration on the longer end of the spectrum and then selling it back later because Theta decay follows an exponential curve with it decaying fastest on the week leading up to expiration. 

The downside to just buying puts are that puts are expensive. An alternative is run a collar, which cap your losses and your gains in exchange. Often times you can run up a collar very cheaply, or for free, or even for a net credit.

To construct a collar, you buy a protective put and you sell a covered call. The beauty of collars is that the put and covered call don't even have to expire on the same week.

Here is an example of a case in which running a collar makes a lot of sense. Since many of you trade Micron, I'll use Micron as an example. So suppose you own Micron and it made a very nice run up before earnings and you are afraid that Micron may disappoint Wall Street's expectations.
For this example, the date is March 16, 2018 and Micron is trading @ $60.

One thing you could do is buy the May 18th Put @ 57.5 for $3.80 and sell the May 18th Call @ 65 for $3.95.
Let's consider 3 cases.
Case 1: Micron trades sideways throughout earnings (57.5 to 62.5). You will end up slightly ahead $0.15 a share.
Case 2: Micron tanks below 57.5. Well aren't you glad you bought that put? You can now either sell the option contracts and the shares of Micron, collect your tendies and post on WSB some shitty memes, wait around till expiration arrives or exercise them early. Exercising them early is almost never recommended as you lose out on all the extrinsic value (unless if you doing some dividend play or something). 
As of 4/6/18, you could have bought back the call for $0.20 and sold that put for around $9.65 and would have been up bigly.
Case 3: Micron goes straight to the moon (Let's say Micron is now at $70). At expiration, you would have missed out on all those gains from the moon. Your put would expire worthless and you would be forced to sell your shares of Micron @ 62.50, however considering that in the end you still made $2.50 a share from that $60, this isn't that bad of a result and while you missed out on some big gains, you at least made money and can deploy that on some trades. 

Now if you were just to buy the 57.5 for $3.80, here are your results.
Case 1: Micron trades sideways, you are now out the $3.80 premium, unless you sell it early, in which you can recoup some of the premium.
Case 2: Micron tanks, you can either wait around until expiration or you can sell the put and share early and you will be very glad that you did so. Note that Micron has to go below 53.70 for you to start to break even.
Case 3: Micron goes to the moon, you can collect all the gains from the moon (and you will be better off than if you had the collar) but you will be out the premium on the put.

Possible 3% upside to consensus EPS estimates for the quarter and is 4% above consensus for the next year. $EL provides strong relative position in prestige beauty, with positive expectations for strong organic growth and compounding earnings growth in the coming years. While the stock has performed well YTD (EL +18.1% vs SPX +0.2%), analysis points $EL as a high-quality name best-positioned within HPC. While Estee Lauder's relatively outside US exposure remains a drag on growth, its leadership position among Chinese consumers is proving an enviable strength today. While analysts expect the quarter to be a positive catalyst for shares, option investors are more worried. In fact, one month normalized skew is at its 81%-ile over the past year ahead of earnings. Supports the view that positioning is light ahead of results, $EL options are implying a +/-5.4% move on earnings, below the median earnings moves over the past 4 quarters.

Sorry for missing the last 2 weeks. I had shit to see and people to do.

Next week's predictions/forecasts are below. Most of these predictions pass the ""smell test,"" but the Fed Interest Rate Decision prediction is clearly not possible. If the Fed is going to raise the prime rate, they'll raise it to 2% (and since the Fed still believes it's in the economy's best interest, long-term, I strongly suspect that we'll get an increase).

**EXPLANATIONS:**

* Methodology: Avg.  of last 6 months actual results * [1 + (YoY simple growth rate / 12)] -- simplistic, sure, but probably still better than the non-farm forecasters.

* Source: [worldeconomiccalendar.com](http://worldeconomiccalendar.com/)

* I'm only planning to do forecasts for the reports that have a ""three bull"" rating. I also **WILL NOT** forecast crude oil inventories because it's a fucking pain in the ass. If you can't live without a forecast for crude oil, just look at what happened over the last few weeks, count how many times it beat v. missed, and expect the trend to follow whichever there's more of (although you should also consider things like weather, prices at the pumps, and so on).

* ""Red,"" ""Boring,"" ""Green,"" are just for fun. I try to base them on real information, but don't get it twisted: THEY'RE GUESSES. If anything, I'm hoping people will take them as a springboard for discussion, since we really do need more real-talk.

    Red = bad

    Boring = $SPY closes within $1 of its opening price

    Green = /u/MrTrader1's mom's dick

**WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT WEEK?**

4/30/18: Red

5/1/18: Green

5/2/18: Red (FOMC = high chance of red)

5/3/18: Red

5/4/18: Boring

Guesses will be revised if/when news requires it. I don't factor Trump into my initial set, but as the week wears on, I do account for his dumbass shenanigans in my commentary and make revisions if needed. Earnings reports don't get factored-in, either way, because I don't have the time to go so in-depth -- and we've seen how, lately, they don't really appear to have much impact on the markets.

Also, don't be surprised if I'm wrong as fuck this week. It's usually fairly straightforward to figure out how the market's feeling, but lately, it's obvious that even the ""smart money"" has no idea what the fuck to do. I'd expect this to mean they're looking for safety, but who the fuck knows these days? When in doubt, base your guesses on your predictions -- even if they look fucking dumb, they're still more reliable than your dumbass emotions.

**Current record:** 7 correct / 10 total

**HOW'D I DO LAST WEEK?**

I missed 2 weeks because of work. Sometimes you just have to take a Saturday to fuck around and do nothing, you know? And sometimes you just have to take a Sunday to fuck around and do nothing, you know? My point is: I really needed to fuck around and do nothing.

One of the ads that was targeted at me was nothing other than a Instagram profile of small dog.  Which means that someone paid actual MONEY to instagram in order to market pictures of this run-of-the-mill terrier in the hopes that this profile would, over time, gain serious traction so that the account could then be monetized.  

This isn't the first time I've seen bizarre sponsored content show up on my feed.  All the time now I see completely average looking people selling nothing but their own mediocre Instagram profile to unsuspecting users.  Who would ever follow these people?? There like 60 million smoking hot chicks that already flood my insta-feed.  Are these people delusional? 

Not to mention all the bland hat and mug companies I forget five seconds after I scroll past them.

From an economic standpoint, Instagram has convinced anyone that anything is truly possible when you pay for advertising.

I believe that this is proof of the massive, unrealistic, economically insolvent system of thought we have now, and understand what FB has been really selling all along, hope.

With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.,"Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot ~~understate~~ overstate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

One day I decided that I would try the stock market (after watching The Big Short), because I'm smart, and it's a good way at getting money, and I had lost a good amount of money in what turned out to be an MLM company? (my mom told me that it was a pyramid scheme, but they showed me the shape and it was an upside down triangle, not a pyramid, but that's not the point). Someone suggested that I get a Robinhood account, so I downloaded the app and opened an account up! I put in about $10, found a cheap stock, and made almost $3 within a matter of a few days! Can you imagine how much money I would've made if I had put more in? This is WAY better than my Ally Bank Account!

So I decided that I was going to be very risky, so I researched the best stocks of 2018! I deposited almost $300, and found this company called SPY. I looked at the fundamentals, and the company's financial documents seem to look solid! I zoomed out for the 5 year chart, and it only seems to go up! If I had put in money five years ago, I almost would have so much! How's that for a stock choice! I bought in and made so much money percentage-wise!

Now, the stock market is like gambling, and I'm 2 for 2, so I want to take my knowledge to Wall Street, because they (and all of you) seem to need it. However, when I look at my University business majors, all I see are majors like ""Finance"" and ""Accounting"", but no majors in stocks! Is there even a stocks major? Help?

Literally, everything you learned about investing comes from this shit hole, memes, and forming an opinion based on facts that reiterate your own opinion. Admit it.

Some of you fucks are literally acting as if ""Priced in"" is a meme we invented. Are you fucking serious? What next, a ""delta"" meme?  

[Ray ""Big Dick"" Dalio](https://www.principles.com/) has a lot of gems to say and interesting a.f. story behind his investment history and business principles. 


&gt; “I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game. This way of learning and improving has been best for me because of what I’m like and because of what I do. I’ve always had a bad rote memory and didn’t like following other people’s instructions, but I loved figuring out how things work for myself. I hated school because of my bad memory but when I was twelve I fell in love with trading the markets. **To make money in the markets, one needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right. That’s because the consensus view is baked into the price.** One is inevitably going to be painfully wrong a lot, so knowing how to do that well is critical to one’s success. To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount. Since I was both an investor and an entrepreneur, I developed a healthy fear of being wrong and figured out an approach to decision making that would maximize my odds of being right.” 


His investment philosophy was very interesting, especially for the time. He viewed the entire world as a machine, and did his best to figure it out. One example was consulting McDicks about how to offer a chicken nugget at a stable price while avoiding the risk of fluctuating chicken prices.

&gt; Among his clients were McDonalds and one of the country's largest chicken producers. McDonalds was about to come out with Chicken McNuggets and was concerned that chicken prices might rise, forcing them to choose between raising their menu prices or having their profit margins squeezed. They wanted to hedge but there was no viable chicken futures market. Chicken producers wouldn't agree to sell at a fixed price because they were worried that their costs would go up and they would then take a loss on their supply contracts. After some thought, Ray went to the largest producer with an idea. A chicken is nothing more than the price of the chick (which is cheap), corn, and soymeal. The corn and soymeal prices were the volatile costs the chicken producer needed to worry about. Ray suggested combining the two into a synthetic future that would effectively hedge the producer's exposure to price fluctuations, allowing them to quote a fixed price to McDonalds. The poultry producer closed the deal and McDonald's introduced the McNugget in 1983.

**Yes, he practically invented mainstream tendies.** 

The book also covers some very technical &amp; dirty details about the economy, bonds, etc. It's a meaty read. 

The fact of the matter is, obviously ya'll enjoy investing, and obviously have plenty of free time. Some of you will never make it past losing your nut on weeklies, and others will actually turn this into a living. Knowledge is the difference.  You don't have to read books -- there are videos and audiobooks. But fucking better yourself and stop acting like priced in is some treat-of-the-week. Stop getting your opinions from the most upvoted comments. 

Love,

Dad

RTN and most other defense companies will go up on Monday. This is what happened last year when the US attacked Syria: https://imgur.com/WhpDXMh 
I expect the market to behave quite similarly. RTN opened at 154.62 simply to  drop lower throughout the day. The stock continued to go lower the days after the attack. So for those, who are thinking to buy big at market open... you should probably rethink that. For those (like me), who hold short-term positions, or options, should probably sell on a strong open. 
   
Now for the general market: I believe that the real threat was that Russia would do something bold. They didn't. I see this more as a release of tension, rather than the buildup. In other words, we have passed the climax. Let's hope that we don't hear to much warmongering on either side. I think the market will still do quite well this week, if earnings are good.

Looking at 2018, with oil in the high $60s, production is growing quickly. This should put a price ceiling for oil somewhere in the high $60s or low $70s. At that price, it’s only a matter of time before supply starts to outweigh demand. The price floor should be somewhere in the low $50s based on fracking production. The two catalysts which can cause prices to go above the ceiling and below the floor are geopolitical strife and economic growth fluctuations.

You can set up a 60% chance probability of profit options trade with bearish bullish or neutral assumptions on just about underlying - this makes it difficult for me to jump in and let the numbers just play out... but that's where my WSB brethren step in to help!

1. Stay current with the sub, noticing any YOLO plays. For me, if the yolo play is documented as being over 10k, I write down the underlying and the wsber's assumption.

2. Look up the underlying in my platform and ensure it has proper liquidy. (ie, SQ set up fine but no liquidity on GRUB)

3. Play around in the options chain, finding a trade that meets your requirements. For me: about 3% (of whole account) maximum risk, 60% percentage of profit (or &lt;.4 delta), and 30-60 days out.

4. Make the trade!

5. Be happy you made an assumption based off of someones DD that warranted their YOLO play.

6. If the trade is a 100% loser, console yourself by remembering that there's someone out there who fared much worse.

For those who don't know the State Department is responsible for enforcing anti trust laws against large corporations. For those who don't know, anti trust laws are to do with stopping companies from gaining monopolies/killing all competition in their industries, for the benefit of the market and the consumers in it. 

Now my friend asked me to be discreet with this information, but I felt the need to share with you guys. FACEBOOK IS FUCKED.

Not only are they facing declining user ship and increased public distaste and distrust due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but now the state department has become aware of a gross violation by Facebook of anti trust laws.

Specifically, FB is TOTALLY blocking the mention of their biggest competitor on their platform. You can't even mention this competitor to your friends in messenger. Yep you guessed it, that competitor is meat spin dot com. Don't believe me? Try and send your buddy a link to the site or share a status with it in it. You will see, totally blocked and not able to share.

Now that the state department is aware of this violation they will be proceeding with the anti trust attack within the next month, and given how clear the violation of section 12 article 6.9 is of the anti trust act, it is likely the proceedings will go very quickly and FB will be broken up into at least 20 smaller companies. expect stock price to plummet as this happens.

That itself indicates why Spotify will win out. 

Spotify doesn't need to pay artists to use their platform. In fact, it's the reverse. Independent musicians are beginning to flock to Spotify as a platform to connect with potential listeners, grow their audience and plan tours. Below is an interview with Nohidea, a very niche musician outside of the main stream media. He currently has 600,000 monthly listeners. 

""[Spotify's] carefully, personally-curated content streamlines a targeted audience for these artists, incomparable to anything else they’d find elsewhere.

They have myriad marketing tools at your disposal to help you recalibrate and define your trajectory and brand, as well as providing you the tools necessary to reach those same audiences and see precise and detailed information as to who they are, what they like, where they live etc.

It’s not only shifted the paradigm of the independent music industry, it’s a necessity for any artist. I see so many artists that have bustling social presence on Soundcloud, but absolutely no music even posted on Spotify. I think that those very same artists are missing out on something truly big, because you could have access to the same tools that huge-name, major-label artists and managers have when they’re doing things such as planning for tours, planning releases, planning for press campaigns and promotional content etc.

Just from something as simple as having your music on Spotify and letting it find its way around to any potential ears, you could plan your own tour.. You can get paid (or not) to go play your music that you created out of love in a different city, maybe even a different country in the world. Anywhere in the world that you want to go, granted you have an audience there. I think that’s so dope"" (http://www.secretshoresmusic.com/2017/09/09/interview-series-nohidea/)

So how does this lead to growth? The millennial generation grew up listening to an unlimited catalogue of music. Listening to the same popular songs each day does not make sense to them. They are not forced to listen to the radio's top hits or watch MTV's 'hottest music videos.' They have options. They are use to defining their own music experience. Spotify helps this new era of music listeners find the sounds that speak to them. Those personal affections speak louder than the current ""hottest pop star."" In other words, Spotify will be organically creating music stars.

Apple, Google and Amazon can copy Spotify but they are far behind and unfocused.",false,88n16a,,0,,false,1529527732,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88n16a/spotifys_secret_sauce/,t3_88n16a,,,,

I m doing a work where i have to invest 200k on the stock market.
However i have no clue where to begin.
Despite i already began, invested on oil companies and thought That w God of war coming and w such good reviews investing in Sony would be good.

Where i need help is on things like justifying or some.lights on why the oil companies stocks went up or down. What are the major factors.

Any good tutorial not.very complex because i dont want to waste a lot of time w this, i hold not much interest w this subject after having an intro class about this. Seemed that they can justify the trend from the past but for the future looked just luck to be honest.

$REGN has been so depressed lately that this play is most likely going to lose money. But I'm banking on a sudden shift in perception before earnings since the stock is at a 2-year low. I either expect share price to hold around $300/share today, or drop to near $290 end of day today, which is when I'll double down on my position.

I am 41 and my 401k balance sucks for my age but I am making decent income,  except in my field that could change very easily. I will have to put three kids through college starting in about ten years so I really need to get this right if I ever want to retire. Can someone please help?

* 1-month implied volatilities for major Asian index options remain cheap as of market close in Asia, closing below their 1-year averages for the second day in a row.  Skew ticked up all major Asia index options and is now fairly valued.  May 11 OTM Calls and Puts on the Nikkei 225 were the most actively traded options in Tokyo.  OTM April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng China Enterprise and April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng were the most actively traded options in Hong Kong.

**European Options**

* Risk premiums are declining slightly off yesterday’s levels with the VSTOXX sitting at 13.3670 after closing at 13.7415 yesterday.  Skew for 1-month Euro Stoxx 50 options has dropped this AM, moving from the 50th percentile yesterday back down below the 30th percentile based on its 1-year average this morning.

Simple bear case inside,"Discussion here should be strictly limited to Q1 2018 performance, thus future investments like Waymo should not be included. Not interested in long term stuff; just playing earnings on Monday.

Also, I personally have no position and am simply looking for someone to provide a bull case that counters the following points:

---

The post is ordered from things that had the most impact on Google's miss in Q4 2017 to the least impact.

Google missed Q4 2017 earnings because its traffic acquisition costs increased significantly. This is due to the increased share of mobile search at the expense of desktop search (Google has to pay Apple for mobile search), as well as mobile search simply being less profitable.

Has Google done anything to remedy this in Q1 2018? I do not believe they have. Mobile as a percentage of total search has probably continued to increase, meaning continued increased traffic acquisition costs and thinner margins.

Speaking more generally, Google's desktop search is being eroded by customers going elsewhere for product searches; elsewhere meaning Amazon. If you are looking to buy a lamp, you used to search ""lamp"" on Google, see an ad for lamps on Amazon, click the link and go to Amazon, and provide Google a profit along the way. Now consumers just search for ""lamp"" on Amazon's own search bar. Nothing Google has done in the past quarter has diminished this trend.

Lastly, Google is seemingly displaying technical negligence in terms of defeating adblocking services. Lets take the example of a search for ""lamp"" with adblock enabled (specifically ublock origin).

- This is [Google's search result](https://i.imgur.com/xAOOzOE.png). No ads anywhere on the page.
- This is [Amazon's search result](https://i.imgur.com/wQz6FBE.png). At first, this is unremarkable, with a similar lack of ads, but [scroll to the bottom....](https://i.imgur.com/LqGd8Og.png) and you clearly see 3 ads.

Also, take the example of the two video services Google and Amazon offer, Youtube and Twitch respectively. Adblock blocks 99+% of ads on Youtube. Adblock blocks 0% of ads on Twitch because Amazon figured out how to inject ads directly into the video stream. As it stands, every video stream provided to a user with adblock on is a money loss for Google.

It is likely that Google simply decides not to counter adblock for pro consumer reasons, but the potential margin miss there will just continue to grow in desktop as more users install adblocking services. Furthermore, look at that Amazon lamp ad again and I doubt any consumers are bothered in the least.

---

Anyway, if anyone actually has a bull case for Google reversing the trends that led to an earnings miss in Q4 2017 i'd like to hear it. As it stands I have no position but if google rises alot on monday then I might sell a call or something.

A Trinity of Tendies\*. And, if you are a shareholder of record by the 31st, you get $0.38 per share back at you. It also posts earnings next week. The market has been rough on it, and I'm confident it can beat earnings.

Why let volatility get you down when you can ride it out for a few months? Think of it like that pot you left on your stove, except instead of burning your house down, it leaves pocket change. And in \~1 year \(such a long time\), the spinoffs of Dow and Corteva will be complete.

Enough bullshit, here's the DD:

Pro Forma EBITDA up 15&amp;#37; yoy

Materials Science\- Future Dow split, this is plastics, performance materials, and some silicones. Estimated 12&amp;#37; growth, and silicones are big money. Silicones are used in everything from sealing your bathtub to paint to lube you use when the market fucks you. Big money also comes from plastics and packaging. EBITDA flat, but sales up 17&amp;#37; yoy. Rank: 1

Agriculture\- Cortevea\- the new unit made from Dow Agroscience, DuPont Pioneer, and DuPont Crop Protection. I'm not really interested in this segment, but they have plenty of new plant traits and pesticides in the pipeline. Monsanto, but with a weirder tagline: ""...to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume..."" Plus they say they are driven by beliefs. Bitch, you're a seed biotech company, who needs ethics anyway.  Rank: 3

Specialty Products\- AKA the 'Oh shit, we have leftover business segments, what do we do'\- the new DuPont. This includes stuff like their soy boi products like lecithin and emulsions, electronics, silicones related to electronics/imaging, transportation, and construction. Stuff like Great Stuff, Styrofoam, Tyvek, Nomex, Kapton, yadda yadda. Why does this matter? These materials matter. They are used in multiple markets and are known by name.

For example: Polysilicon is used in chipmaking. AMD/NVDA/INTC uses this silicon to make their stuff. Why invest in the end product when you can get into the producer of the raw materials? Buy the refiner, not the gas station.

Plus, demand for polysilicon is sure to rise with the increasing demand of solar cells. Tyvek had double\-digit growth yoy due to demand. Rank: 2

**FAQs**

**What is this?**

This is a list of calls and puts that pass basic filters. Simplistically, it's looking for ""cheap"" options based on ask price. At first, the maximum price was $1 or less, but since volatility came back, it's been raised to $1.50. There are also basic volume, average daily trading volume for the underlying equity, and open interest screens it must pass.

**What this list is not**

This is not a recommendation to buy any of these. This is a jumping off point, looking for lottery tickets (though many of them are better than that). Options are often all or nothing, so only risk what you are willing to lose 100% of (unlike say, equities). If you don't know what the hell any of these mean, stay away. This isn't Options 101 here.

If you want to learn more about options, [go here for a starting point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/)

**How should I use this?**

That's a lot to unpack but for a first time I'd stick to:

Call options that need little movement (smallest %Change to ATM). Look though at how much is needed to be at the money and then how it's traded over the past year or so. A 5% move might not seem like much, but some stocks don't move that big over 3-4 months. Also see if the strike price is an all-time high or a rebound. I'd feel much more comfortable buying a strike that the stock has already reached before than one that would need to be 5-10% above the all-time high.

Start small, and don't drop $5K on one. Most of these should be cheap-ish, so you should be able to buy 10-20 for &lt;$1K and even that might be too big of a bet for your first (depending on how much you have).

I also personally look for options that don't need to move a large amount just to make a good profit.

http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

That's a good site to run your potential buy through to see what kind of return you'd make if it only moves a bit.

Ideally I like to see 80-100% return somewhat early on, but that's also going to be a function of how cheap the option is (an option can go from $0.05 to $0.10 easier than $1 to $2).

Keep it small, choose an option that only needs little relative movement and is far out. Usually you have to pay a premium for that, but if you scour the list enough you can find some good deals.

**What is the equity screener?**

I don't truthfully invest in options that much, but I'm active in equities. This screener looks for stocks that match certain criteria, looking for either growth or value. Like the options list, this is not a recommendation. Do your own research.

Due to general negative sentiment in the markets, I'm laying off on high-risk plays for now and have instead gone deep into Disney Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPSs) for a somewhat risky and leveraged play without the extreme risk of FDs. I'm still in on the PTLA play for anyone wondering. The day after PTLA's FDA decision is Cinco de Mayo, so no matter which way this play goes, you can go get wasted the next day. 

-

FDs aren't for everyone. They rely on short-term movement in your direction, otherwise they can quickly drop 50%+. 

LEAPS however are a bit like leveraged shares when looking in the 2-3 month range. A change of 1% in the underlying could equate to a change of 3% to 10% in LEAPS -- this change does not extrapolate when you get into large changes, and the change depends on how OTM or ITM you go. Time decay is also minimal and sometimes insignificant when you take into account an upcoming catalyst. So while there is, theoretically and actually, time decay on LEAPS over the course of a single week or two, that time decay is overshadowed by any catalyst that may also be coming up in that time frame. 

Nice thing about LEAPS is that you can actually baghold them if the play doesn't go your way. I still would advise against it, but it's possible. Time decay on LEAPS is relatively low as long as you're not bagholding 5+ months or something after the play has gone sour. So LEAPS are good for largely stable companies with strong fundamentals and support.

* **DIS Jan 2020 120.00 calls**

I'm choosing Disney here because it hasn't dropped too much below $100/share lately. For over a month now, Disney has been trading in the $98-$102 range, which makes me think that it will be stable going into earnings on May 8th. I bought over 17 grand worth of LEAPS yesterday because I'm banking on a small reversal in price leading up to earnings. I also thought that today would be a green day after a reversal in general sentiment, but I guess that didn't pan out. The markets are still taking profits and selling off on good news. Since yesterday, my LEAPS have decreased in value by around 5% due to an underlying drop of around 1%. This should give you an idea of how much leverage you're getting into.

I think Disney is going to announce concrete plans, this coming earnings report, about exiting Netflix in 2019 and launching their own streaming service. We're only 7 months away from 2019. I'm also basing this prediction on Disney's hopeful acquisition of Fox and its eventual majority ownership of Hulu. The deal is being held up by Comcast's unrequited love for Sky plc, but beyond that, I think it's inevitable that Disney eventually come in control of Hulu. Comcast will overpay for Sky plc, and Disney will come out ahead because they'll get to own Hulu for cheaper. 

After that, it's only a matter of time that Disney launches its own streaming service, which will completely overshadow Netflix. If there's anything Disney does really well, it's making hit movies for all age groups.  

-

I'm betting on a move back up to the $110/share range, which would make these calls **profit ~70%**. A move up to $110/share is where Disney was roughly 2 months ago. If Infinity War brings in a $3B box office, we could see a couple percent increase in share price as well. A move up to $105/share would make these calls **profit ~30%**. 

This play is, I believe, not *that* risky because I don't expect Disney to drop below $90/share. Disney would have to announce some truly devastating news, which I don't think is possible. A drop to $90/share would make these calls lose up to 50% in value, which is a lot, but is something I believe to be a worst-case scenario. I also don't think Disney would stay at $90/share for long.

Its founders must have left the company to rot, having already made billions at IPO. And while that's true to an extent, it only needs to pivot in order to escape the fate of its peers.

The GoPro brand still stands strong, even with weak sales. Its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoProCamera) has over five million subscribers and it maintains a good position on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=gopro). And all of their cameras are of high quality and have good reviews. By all accounts, they should be a success. But their lack of success comes from a lack of product-market fit and a lackluster attempt at fixing that problem.

The best explanation for GoPro's sales decline comes from amateurs only ever buying one GoPro in their lives. But that's mainly a property of consumers, who usually have less available funds and are usually content. This is why $FIT failed as well: consumers have flat demands that can be met too easily. Companies, meanwhile, need to invest in the best equipment in order to produce the best products lest they get outcompeted. That's how drone and camera companies mainly survive, as they sell to small to large video production companies.

GoPro knows this, and that's why they released the Karma. Had they applied the same level of quality that they did to their cameras, it could have saved the company. But instead, they produced a mediocre product with an above average price. It's hard to tell why that happened, though hopefully, [the CEO pay cut](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/gopro-ceo-sees-salary-slashed-to-1-after-dire-2017.html) will incentivize better behavior. Also, there exist other markets such as VR cameras that GoPro can enter that have a lower probability of failure.

And if that does not work, there always exists the possibility of an acquisition. GoPro has what many other companies do not: a streamlined production pipeline. Point is, there's a higher probability that GoPro can get itself out of its hole than what its stock price says.

It's time to disintimate,"**Long $AAPL, long $AMZN, short $V short $MA short $AXP, neutral on $SQ**

Why can't we just have digital payments like they do in China? WeChat Pay charges .6%, which is way cheaper than the 2.75% that Square charges which is in line with other merchant banks. 

I think every time Bezos sees this 0.3% fee he has to pay to Visa or Mastercard plus merchant bank fees he unzips and begins to masturbate out of pure rage. That's $450M a year. Why do you think AMZN wants to get into financial services?

I understand the 2.75% is largely based on credit risk and basically pays for consumer protection but there are better debit-based ways we can solve this problem. Consumer should bear the cost of consumer protection or they should guard their wallet better. It's basically theft to charge 2.75% for debit cards since they carry much less chargeback risk than credit cards. Or use mobile-based security like face recognition that solves the problem with technology. Or just have an account on Amazon. They have my sensitive information anyway.

It's time to disintimate. And this is gonna happen in like 5-10 years I guarantee it.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Latest edit: this has been helpful. Thanks all.

EDIT: so far suggested is - 

i) not holding on to winners long enough.

ii) holding on to winners too long.

iii) letting losers sink too far.

iii) Fees and spreads skew the game against you.

iv) Use trailing stops.

v) Avoid thrill-seeking yolo gambles when everything is calm

vi) Be aware of and avoid the tendency to become risk seeking after sustaining a loss.

7) The wonder of compound percentage multiplication and how it favours losses.

&amp;nbsp;

RESULTING INSIGHTS:

I - USE STOP LOSS and Risk management:

I think this says something. I think the consensus is right. You need to limit your downside and define a point where you accept that you are wrong or that you cannot afford to wait to see if you are eventually right. From now on I'll cap downside at 2.5% of account value. It's important to have account value big enough and to make trades small enough that 2.5% isn't too tight. Use trailing stops where possible. Seek alternative methods of visualising risk such as VaR. 

&amp;nbsp;

II - TAKE PROFIT and be more selective:

Timing the exit on a winner is probably the hardest thing. Is there a good way to define your expected upside? I guess it depends on how good you are at picking. If you pick right 52% of the time, and you always define your up and downside at the same amount than you will eventually gain money. This also means that you shouldn't enter trades that you think aren't going to go up by at least 2.5% of account value if you want a 1:1 risk to reward. If you think it's going to go up by 1% of account value, too bad, unless you're confident enough to put a stop loss at the same position

&amp;nbsp;

III - FEES AND SPREADS - its a negative sum game in the short run:

Every time you enter a position you have to cross the spread and in many cases, pay broker fees. This means that if you reckon you pick well 50% of the time you'll lose money long run. 1:1 risk to reward and 50% accuracy are not enough to trade profitably. Either your accuracy needs to go up or your risk to reward needs to improve. 

&amp;nbsp;

IV - HUMAN TENDENCIES:

I and II are rules to minimise the affect of human nature to hold losers and sell winners early. When things are calm, test out yolo trades on a practice account instead of throwing your savings into a bin. Let your stop losses take the emotion out of losses, heaping on random trades after an irritating loss is putting it 100% to chance and, as stated in III,  the odds are against you in the short run. Losses are a sunk cost. Serial small losses are much less damaging than one time large losses and so avoid large retard bets, especially those made under duress.

Everyone chill. 3% rates don't mean anything other than valuations drop just a bit, but you've got to get to 6% before things really get scary. Rates rise because the economy is getting better, which is **good**. Meanwhile corporations are making beaucoup money, record share buybacks, and capex spending.

Rising rates coincide with positive equity returns 90% of the time.

2018 year-end S&amp;P 500 target = 3000; long-term target (year-end 2025) = 3500

&gt; **Noise doesn’t drive market returns**

&gt; Trade, geopolitics, rates (3%! 3%!) and inflation risks make for exciting headlines. But our work suggests that the factors that matter most for stock returns are valuation, sentiment and growth. Valuation: the **market is broadly expensive**, suggesting sub-par longer term returns, but **multiples are well-below January and Tech bubble peaks.** Sentiment: equity investor sentiment / positioning measures indicate** bullishness but no  euphoria**. Growth: EPS growth expectations are likely to be revised higher before declining; sales revisions are improving, corporates are guiding up, and whereas some macro trends have decelerated, this was to be expected given lofty levels

&gt;  Our US regime model puts us **firmly in mid cycle, and no new bear market signposts have been triggered** (still at 68%, where 80% would suggest selling). So be nimble, pick your spots, but stay invested

-

&gt; Buybacks by BofAML’s corporate clients have been accelerating, tracking +88% YoY year-to-date. The current pace implies over $850bn in S&amp;P 500 buybacks this year (a record). Dividend growth in 1Q spiked to a 3+ year high, marking the first quarter of no S&amp;P 500 dividend cuts since at least ‘03. 

-

&gt; As rates climb higher (10yr Tsy yield now at 3%), the question du jour is “what level hurts equities?” There’s no magic number, **but average returns have only been negative when the 10yr climbed above 6%**. 

&gt; What’s driving rates is most important, in our view (i.e., credit shock vs. materializing growth). And while rising interest rates could eventually hurt margins, the impact should be gradual as large cap debt is mostly long-term (7yrs) and fixed-rate. Inflation may be the bigger risk to mar

When a stock beats earnings and has a rise in price shortly after it is typical to see a downward correction shortly after right? Is it typical to sell if the stock begins to fall in the hopes to pick it back up later for a lower price?

I picked up some shares in two stocks that beat earnings (F and AMD) and am wondering when the optimal time to sell is. I like both stocks semi-long term but am wondering if I should try to lock in some earnings here. I also would like to pick up some FB shares if the price corrects itself after this spike.

4. Check to see if the option is up. If your option is up, great, simply sell it, Robinhood is unable to exercise the option if you sold it first. So the email doesn't matter. If the option is down, simply wait for the first email to be responded to, which should take 30 min.
5. If the option went down, the timestamp on the email will count as the exercise date. Thus your account will be credited with NEAR your original money.
6. Either you made some DANK gains, or lost next to nothing. Risk minimized, gains to the MAX.

**FAQs**

**What is this?**

This is a list of calls and puts that pass basic filters. Simplistically, it's looking for ""cheap"" options based on ask price. At first, the maximum price was $1 or less, but since volatility came back, it's been raised to $1.50. There are also basic volume, average daily trading volume for the underlying equity, and open interest screens it must pass. 

**What this list is not**

This is **not** a recommendation to buy any of these. This is a jumping off point, looking for lottery tickets (though many of them are better than that). Options are often all or nothing, so only risk what you are willing to lose 100% of (unlike say, equities). If you don't know what the hell any of these mean, **stay away**. This isn't Options 101 here.

If you want to learn more about options, [go here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) for a starting point.

**How should I use this?**

That's a lot to unpack but for a first time I'd stick to:

Call options that need little movement (smallest %Change to ATM). Look though at how much is needed to be at the money and then how it's traded over the past year or so. A 5% move might not seem like much, but some stocks don't move that big over 3-4 months. Also see if the strike price is an all-time high or a rebound. I'd feel much more comfortable buying a strike that the stock has already reached before than one that would need to be 5-10% above the all-time high.

Start small, and don't drop $5K on one. Most of these should be cheap-ish, so you should be able to buy 10-20 for &lt;$1K and even that might be too big of a bet for your first (depending on how much you have).

I also personally look for options that don't need to move a large amount just to make a good profit.

That's a good site to run your potential buy through to see what kind of return you'd make if it only moves a bit.

Ideally I like to see 80-100% return somewhat early on, but that's also going to be a function of how cheap the option is (an option can go from $0.05 to $0.10 easier than $1 to $2).

Keep it small, choose an option that only needs little relative movement and is far out. Usually you have to pay a premium for that, but if you scour the list enough you can find some good deals.

**What is the equity screener?**

I don't truthfully invest in options that much, but I'm active in equities. This screener looks for stocks that match certain criteria, looking for either growth or value. Like the options list, **this is not a recommendation**. Do your own research.

At first look CMG underlying price just seems to tank earnings each go for the recent history.  Def was looking at buying ATM yolo puts.  TBH though I am currently bi-curious, haven't gone full fag yet, and have *always* put some sort of coverage on the bet which limits my gains...but makes sure if I fuck up I don't lose all the steady gains I've made from disciplined moves.  

But fuck it, wanting to make the move I did some research and have come across nothing but positive sentiment for the underlying price of CMG after earnings this week.  Def didn't expect that so I put together a *what if* that would give me an attractive risk to reward.  Buying CMG FD Vertical 350/362.50.

This would be a max risk of $248 and top out at $1002 if the underlying reached $363.  Even if I managed at 50% this would be a great win and with the other greeks involved its not so crazy to see it hit positive this week.

Should I instead sell the same bet and collect off IV crush instead though?  I dunno, lmk what you think.

GOOG is obviously one of the more influential ERs, and its coming at a time when people are pretty concerned about the 10 yr bonds, especially with the all the media talks about getting close to the end of a bull market.  How big of an impact on the broader markets do you think a huge miss from a tech giant would have?  

Theres still AMZN, FB and AAPL but im not particularly bullish on those either. Well maybe AMZN, but I feel like AMZN *really* needs to beat because so much hype is priced in that just hitting estimates would result in a sell off. FB has FB problems and I think AAPL hasnt been doing well enough to have a blowout ER.  (I think AAPL is really just artificially inflated by WB).

Im not saying its likely, but I cant help but feel like the markets are in a precarious position right now and we're only a few misses away from a second big correction.  Not to mention the FED meeting next week howeverI think the possibility of a rate hike is ridiculously low.

&gt;86 S&amp;P 500 companies (27% of 1Q earnings) have reported. Better-than-expected results from Financials, particularly Capital Markets, and industrials, led by Industrial Conglomerates, drove bottom-up EPS to $36.54 from $36.14 a week ago. This is now in line with our $36.50 forecast and 1% above analysts’ expectations on April 1

-

&gt;...Analysts now expect earnings growth of nearly +18% YoY, on sales growth of +7% YoY, where sales are coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, 73% of companies have beaten on EPS, 67% have beaten on sales and 51% have beaten on both. This is the second-highest proportion of top and bottom line beats following Week 2 (after last quarter’s record) since we began tracking the data in late 2011.

-

&gt; Our recent conversations with investors suggested that whereas most expected this to be a strong earnings season, this was likely priced in – if everyone expects it to be a good quarter, earnings are unlikely to drive performance. But performance of our ~50 quantitative factors tell a different story: the four best-performing attributes are all earnings-related (High EPS Estimate Dispersion, High EPS Estimate Revisions, High EPS Momentum, and High Projected 5yr EPS Growth).

-

&gt; ...Whereas guidance data is still sparse (18 instances of guidance by S&amp;P 500 companies month-to-date), just one company (PNR) has issued below-consensus guidance—the rest have been above-consensus or in-line.

I'm a shareholder but I'm not buying any calls. The realistic ones have a big premium that I'm not completely willing to risk.

Are you ready to stop paying IV like you’re his hoe and he’s your pimp? Are you a bad enough dude to join me in flight amongst the butterflies and iron condors?

Disclosure: today was day one of trading this strategy. My spread (from left to right) was long 1 SPX 2645 put, short 2 SPX 2650 puts, and long 1 SPX 2655 put. 

Result: my spread traded within the money range for most of the afternoon but in the last 30 minutes trailed off and ultimately finished OTM. 

Rationale/Going forward: SPX weeklies expire every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Although my aforementioned 0-day spread had only a 11% PoP, the payout ITM was nearly 20 to 1. (I.e. cost basis / max loss was $40, and max gain was $690)

In other words, if you were to employ this very strategy every day over the next 20 weekly expiration days, you’d only need to hit on one spread to break even with the cost to enter 20 similar trades (not including broker fees) and a 10% PoP implies that 2 out of every 20 trades will be profitable.

**Exhibit 1**

March 21st a compensation package valued at 2.6 billion will be approved for Musk. This package will grant him over 500 million dollars for market caps reached at 100 Billion and at 50 billion increments above that, vesting 1% of the shares outstanding per increment up to 12% of shares outstanding. It is reliant on market based milestones, which musk can influence with his public brand and on acquisitions to further integrate the company as a renewable energy company. The exercise price is that of TSLA shares on Jan 18 2018, around $350. Additionally the vesting is reliant on operational milestones involving increased revenues and EBIDTA. The operational requirements may be achieved through aggressive accounting practices and wouldn't be hurt by strange depreciation accounting that would improve FCF. In the current compensation plan, Musk is required to have TSLA achieve 30% or more in gross margins for several consecutive quarters. We have instances of capitalisation of expenses that has helped get TSLA’s margins close to that number in previous years. If Musk believes or sees that these milestones are unreachable, even with the zeal that he can inspire in his followers, he may very well jump ship. When you realise that they don't expense R&amp;D as cost of goods sold then you realise what is being done to inflate the gross margin figures.

**Exhibit 2**

SolarCity acquisition should have been illegal from a corporate governance point of view. Six of Tesla’s seven directors have clear ties to SolarCity. Tesla’s board includes SolarCity’s former CFO, a SolarCity director, and two VCs whose firms also have seats on SolarCity’s board, along with Musk’s brother, Kimbal. Musk chairs both companies and is SolarCity’s largest shareholder. He has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines to buy more shares in SolarCity and Tesla when advantageous. SpaceX, his aerospace company, has purchased $165 million in bonds issued by SolarCity. Some analysts cautioned that Musk might be self-dealing, rescuing his own investments and his cousins’ company through this purchase. Hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos, who had shorted Tesla and SolarCity, called the acquisition a “shameful example of corporate governance at its worst,” a “bailout” of SolarCity that “strikes us as just the height of folly.” SolarCity was not doing well, Chanos believed that it was on its way to bankruptcy, with its bonds yielding over 20% by the time that they were bought.

**Exhibit 3**

Musk’s public popularity raises valuations of the companies who he attaches himself to. He has been touted as the world’s Tony Stark. Just go to YouTube to watch the drivel that fanboys post about him. Recently and notably, Youtuber boyinaband has begun to celebrate Musk with his audience and the amount of absurd “thug life” and “MUSK DESTROYS” compilations on youtube is beginning to rival that of Jordan Peterson.

**Exhibit 4**

Along with these liquid stock grants that further dilute shareholders, TSLA equity finances a lot, especially, it seems, when they assure shareholders that they have no plans to. They also issue a lot of debt, and are not transparent with their plans to raise capital. When asked about TSLA capital needs in last year’s Q2, Musk responded, “And now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but we're not thinking about an equity raise.” Considering that the Company announced the debt raise less than a week later and is already on a roadshow, management was clearly well past the “thinking about” stage at the time of Q2 earnings. In fact, the Company seems already well on its way to a raise in contacting debt rating agencies and planning for a roadshow. Readers can determine whether Tesla’s representation during earnings call was accurate. There are many other instances of this kind of behaviour by TSLA management, and is not a credit to their credibility. Their only positive cash flows come from financing activities and they now have a D/E of 2.22. It is clear from a quick look at their cash flow statements that even in 2017 they are raising far more debt than they are paying back. Also they keep claiming in their 10-K that they are innovative manufacturers, and are supremely safe, meanwhile they have to borrow Panasonic employees and are hand-assembling batteries, and they change their production forecasts downwards many times a season.



**Exhibit 5**

They are becoming increasingly unprofitable as their revenues scale. This is highly unusual as one would expect that fixed costs would begin to be spread as they scale. This points to a break even point at lower rather than higher than current sales volumes given the current infrastructure. This of course would run completely contrary to their plans of becoming an all round provider of sustainable energy vehicles and other products. Their interest expenses have also more than doubled moving into 2017, with precipitous increases in SG&amp;A expenses. These lower incomes are not as a result of higher R&amp;D costs, as those have risen less than proportionally. Their EPS fell by 200% from 2016 to 2017.

**Exhibit 6**

Other than Elon Musk, CFO Deepak Ahuja and CTO J.B. Straubel no other executives are listed on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filings. Over the last year over 30 Executives and directors have left the company including chiefs in accounting and the CFO and the head of the Autopilot engineering division. This is an especially bad sign and is the hallmark of a failing company.

**Exhibit 7**

TSLA are no longer leaders in the most vigorous part of automobiles, which is autonomous vehicles. Among the largest market cap automobile manufacturers, TSLA has relatively unsophisticated autonomy in cars so far, trailing even behind GM. Considering that they were touted as pioneers in this field, with their first forays with NVDA, this does not bode well. Also given the lack of scrutiny that investors place on Musk, most likely the stock price still has expectations of leadership in autonomous vehicles baked into the price.

**Exhibit 8**

Many other incumbents are catching up to TSLA in high end EVs, and already has a presence in economy EVs segment. The market is very competitive and there is no reason to expect that TSLA will become leaders. Also TSLA has huge reliability issues according to TrueDelta.com, ranking as the most unreliable car purchasable in America.

**Exhibit 9**

Tesla may not be eligible for the subsidies granted by the government, given that the Model S pollutes more than a Jeep on a per mile basis in the US, when accounting for the pollution in production and recharging.

**Exhibit 10**

Tax credits in the US will no longer benefit TSLA in its Solar Energy provisions post December 2021. The services that they provide will no longer be tax exempt for residences. Expenditures only include set up costs, set up services are also provided by TSLA. By 2025, economic benefits for electric cars will also disappear in Norway if gas cars become banned. People will then flock to other auto manufacturers producing electric cars as the demand for TSLA exceeds supply.

* Quoted from the 10-K risk section:

&gt;We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, in April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the U.S. for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the U.S. We currently expect such 200,000th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles.

This will all further fuck their shitty cash flows.

Reservation deposits are another way to finance the company.

Verbiage is relatively extravagant, overstating or emphasising features of their products that are not differentiating and are completely expected given their sector. For example their use of inverters, that they write their own software, make their own UI, the autopilot feature which is reportedly not better than many competitors and the fact that their power storage is infinitely scalable. Also they claim that they have core competencies in powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage, then they disclose in the risk section that they HAVE NO EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN MANUFACTURING VEHICLES IN HIGH VOLUMES. Clearly they are not competent in their core competencies. In producing the Model 3, they were so incapable of meeting demand that some of the production line is by hand, there were constant bottlenecks, quality control employees were totally inexperienced is automobiles. Batteries could be defective and management apparently didn’t care. Apparently their stress tests aren’t efficient either.

**Exhibit 13**

Solar City’s lease agreement model is highly risky for homeowners to agree to, it puts their house to a commitment to pay rising prices for a technology whose efficiency and cost is decreasing in the long term. It’s like buying a 20 year bond when you know rates are going up, it’s totally retarded and becomes a huge liability on the house when you need to sell it, because only a braindead idiot would want to buy a house on which they are forced to pay a coupon out to Solar City on a less than optimal solar rig. It’s like a subprime lending company. And Solar City won’t be able to compete against highly subsidised and technologically advanced solar manufacturers like DQ in China in the regular solar panel sales market. They have no claim on the residential market. Also it’s worth mentioning that Elon’s cousins run the company, and Elon is majority shareholder. So he basically bailed his family out of this shitty company when he bought it. It’s as cancerous as Goldman Sachs.

**Exhibit 14**

Out of warranty, Teslas become extremely expensive, especially since the way they’re built and service policies require less modular servicing. The battery costs 12000 dollars to replace for the Model S, and 40000 dollars for the Roadster, door handles cost 1000 dollars to replace each, and apparently they’re highly unreliable, 5000 dollars to replace the touchscreen which can become discoloured or even misaligned leading to freezing. Drive unit replacement would cost 6000 dollars out of pocket, which is composed of the entire so called power train, this is the source of the lack of modularity in repairs. Also TSLA does not support the used car market very well, apparently parts for salvage vehicles are impossible to acquire for “safety reasons”, even though competitor electric car makers do provide salvage parts, and it is not possible to see the service history of a used car.

**Exhibit 15**

Tesla has a penchant for forecasting very unrealistic production numbers. Their forecasts for weekly production at the beginning of the year were 5000 units of the Model 3 per week by Q2. They said they’d have this production rate by mid 2017 before, and now they're making about 700 units a week, when they said they'd pull off 2500 by the end of Q1. Also TSLA has started issuing VIN insequencially, so it is more difficult to track production rates and service rates of newer vehicles.

**Exhibit 16**

While most investors are aware Tesla had received 518,000 Model 3 reservations as-of early August, 63,000 of which had been cancelled (12.16%), few know the problems Tesla has faced trying to get their own employees to convert Model 3 deposits to reservations. Tesla and SpaceX employees placed an estimated 13,000 Model 3 reservations and Tesla was counting on this army of employee beta testers, bound by NDAs and the threat of being fired (or worse, losing their stock option grants) to beta-test the Model 3 without leaking details to the public. Quite surprisingly, on November 15th Tesla sent out the first batch of Model 3 configuration invitations to non-employees (Electrek reported non-employee configurations on November 21st) with the first known non-employee VIN assigned November 22nd and the earliest confirmed non-employee delivery on December 20th. Based on Tesla’s fourth quarter production and delivery press release, a total of 1,892 Model 3s had been produced prior to December 21st - indicating the estimated 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations translated into perhaps 1,500 firm orders (11.5%).

**Exhibit 17**

The price is just too high on the Model 3, which is supposed to be their mass market product. Tesla is only shipping the ‘Long Range’ Model 3 loaded with mandatory options: Not only are there very few $51,000+ compact sedans in the world (for good reason), reservations holders initially believed they were purchasing a $35,000 vehicle ($25,000 net of Federal and State tax credits) with $5,000 to $10,000 of potential options. The shift in pricing likely explains our estimated 11.5% conversion rate on Tesla’s 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations - these are primarily hourly workers, after all! Apparently sales in the Model 3 price range is just 1/6th of the sales in the 20k-30k. So much for mass market.

**Exhibit 18**

On the gross margin front, due to Tesla’s ‘unique’ accounting, we forecast gross margins of 15% to 20% for the Model 3 at average sales prices $46,500 per copy - but this will merely be an accounting mirage: If we apply traditional automaker accounting to our Model 3 forecasts - reducing the sales price by 10% to re-allocate SG&amp;A (19.41% at Tesla versus 7% for Ford and GM) as well as include expensed R&amp;D in COGS, the $46,500 Model 3 would generate gross margins of –7.48%. The irony is that Tesla’s bull case (a mainstream car) is finally here, quite possibly bringing about their downfall (via massively flawed business model). The way this happens is by reducing the gross margin by the 10% discount that regular automakers give to dealerships, that save them SG&amp;A expenses, TSLA’s gross margins look nothing special. But when you realise that TSLA expenses R&amp;D costs that should be in in COGS in a separate line, since it’s development on current vehicles, the gross margins are actually much worse than the other companies.

I am going to introduce a new game to you all so that you can literally gamble on the stock market as if it were a roulette table at your local casino.

The game is called **Autist’s Roulette** and it is played by guessing the point range that SPY will be in at the end of the week.

Using an option strategy call an **iron condor**  you can actually make this bet with real money, and the payoffs can be surprisingly huge.

You might say, “But hold up Shady, what the fuck is an iron condor?” I will briefly explain it for you fuckbois who are too lazy or too stupid to go on investopedia. An iron condor is an option strategy that makes money when the underlying falls within a certain range. You do this by selling a call and selling a put, the range in between which is where you will make the most money. You then use that premium to buy a call and buy a put that are just outside of the ones you wrote in order to limit the maximum loss. The inner legs (the options you write) are the body of the bird, and the outter legs (the options you buy) are the wings. Hence iron condor. Simple enough right? Probably not for most of you.

Now the gains from an iron condor are pretty modest, but, if you make the inner legs closer together, and keep the outer legs within one point, then you can get a return of up to 2, 3, 5, or more times your maximum risk in one week

Now let me explain how it works using a fictional casino.

It’s monday at 9:30am and you walk into the casino to find a new game, **Autists’ Roulette**. There is a big roulette wheel with all the possible prices for SPY this week listed on it. Say SPY is currently at 266.50 right now. Numbers closer to the current number that SPY is at have a larger slice of the wheel. The further away the numbers are then the smaller the slice gets, hence these ones being less likely to land on. If you win, your bet turns into $100, if you lose then the casino takes your bet. The thing is that bets with larger slices of the wheel will have a higher buy-in, so you will make less money. You want to bet that SPY is gunna close in its 266-267 range on friday.  The dealer says the bet will cost you $41 (he is gunna use this money to sell a 266P and a 267C then buy a 265P and a 268C for a net credit of $59). He spins the wheel, and it doesn’t stop until friday at 4pm. Turns out you were right, and the wheel lands on 266.73. The dealer takes your $41 and hands you a crispy $100  bill. Congratulations, you have more than doubled your money in just a week.

In short, **Autists’ Roulette** is a game where you try and pick the correct one point spread that SPY will close in on friday. I figured if you guys were sick of losing money on FD’s then you could give this strategy a try in order to triple or double your gainz in only a week.

## 1. What are options?

Nobody really knows. If someone claims to know, they're a liar, and can't be trusted. Some smarty pants will try to tell you that options allow you to get the option to buy a stock at a certain price, but that's stupid. Options are just a way to gamble on stocks more. They'll swing a lot more wildly, like the long wiener of a giraffe, galloping in the African Savannah. 

## 2. What do I need to know?

Options have an expiration date. This is any time in the future. Usually a Friday or whatever I guess. The further in the future - the more expensive the option will be. This is because there's a lot bigger chance that AMD hits $12 some time in the next year, than some time in the next week. Options also have a lot of weird symbols and terms associated with them. None of them matter. Trade with your heart, not your mind.

## 3. What strategy should I use?

You're asking the wrong question hombre. Here's what you need to know. Always buy options that are less than a month away from expiry. A week or less is real tasty. They're cheap, and they'll go crazy on you. There's a lot of hairy gay men that will pay you good money to rub their taint. Unrelated - just wanted to talk about some good memories I have with my dad. Anyway - here's what you do. In robinhood - look at a stock. The one day chart. Then the 1 week chart. Then the 1 month chart. Then use your heart and your cock to try and predict the future. This is the hard part. Literally - you're gonna want to be at full mast. If you think the stonck is going to go up more **BUY PUTS** if you think it's going to go down **BUY CALLS**.

I call this the '*HardBoi*' strategy. It works because your heart and your cock are stupid, stupid organs, and don't know shit. They'll get it wrong more than they get it right. That's how come I keep impregnating these dollar store whores. I owe so much in child support.


## 4. When to sell?

Warren Buffet (RIP) famously said that he wish he never sold a stocc in his life. Warren Buffet is a stinky old man and I bet he can't even get hard any more. If your option is ""OUT OF THE MONEY"" aka ""**REAL STANKY**"" aka ""***NO BUENO***"" you're gonna wanna hold on to that shit. If you sell it, you realize the loss. If you hold it until it expires - the loss turns into fairy dust and joins the fabric of all life. If your option is ""IN THE MONEY"" aka ""**GREEN BOI**"" aka ""***BAILEY JAYS DELIGHT***"" you have to sell it. No ifs ands or buts. If you're trading options with short expiries, you gotta eat em up as soon as they're green.

I have a trading tip that is flawless. Simply put - invest in double leveraged ETFs. Here is why. 

If the underlying goes up +1% = positive Times positive equals positive = +2%

If the underlying goes -1% = negative times negative equals positive. +2%. 

Either way it’s positive. Wall Street does not want people to know this which is why triple leveraged etfs are ones most oft talked about. But it is a trick that is simply and effective. 

Good luck traders!",false,8buvws,,0,,false,1529585484,false,self,t5_2th52,false,stocks,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8buvws/trading_tip/,t3_8buvws,,,Stocks,

\- beat on profitability

\- guidance raise

\- path to debt eradication

\- strong roadmap ahead, etc etc

Good news is this is the best opportunity for profit you will get in a while.

---

First, it is important to understand why Google crashed. Google views itself as an all powerful panopticon that should compete in every industry that remotely interacts with the internet. In recent years, this position has been strongly challenged by Amazon. Thus, in recent quarters, Google has been scrambling to invest in ways that would allow it to compete with Amazon.

This effort, at least in the eyes of investors, has failed spectacularly. The problem? Google is (was) a very profitable company. Amazon historically makes absolutely no profit. Whenever Google opens up a new front to compete against Amazon, it loses margin. Whenever Amazon does anything to compete with Google, it gains margin because its core business is 0 profit or negative. Google's investors have gotten used to making fat profits every quarter, and its current trajectory of diminishing margins has led investors to punish the stock tremendously.

So now that Google has crashed its own stock and brought the broader tech companies along with it, how do you profit? Easy, invest in FANGesque companies that DO NOT compete with Amazon and was brought down without reason by Google.

Both Twitter and Facebook are companies that investors have tied to Google, but neither of these companies have made any moves in this quarter or in any recent quarter to compete directly with Amazon; and Amazon is not competing with them either. Earnings expectations for these companies (both report on wednesday) have now been lowered when they should not have been. Expect margins to remain intact and a rally when they report (Netflix style).

And of course, invest in Amazon itself. Reinvest all of your gains from Twitter and Facebook calls into Amazon calls on Thursday.

All of these companies have had major data breaches in the last 5 years and have relied essentially entirely on intel servers. 

Now fast forward to the era of EPYC in front of us: essentially unaffected by Spectre/Meltdown, more cores (32 vs 28 on AMD EPYC 7000 vs Intel Skylake Xeon respectively), better I/O performance, reduced cost. 

For the first time in 6 years a credible alternative is available and AMD already has work with all of the super 7, doubling market server share (albeit from a small percent) in Q4 2017. 

Thoughts on AMDs prospects for the longer term simply on data security being a large driving factor for server share growth? 

Assumed counter argument: “Everyone’s already forgotten about Equifax, Data security is an issue that does not have long lasting implications.”

* 1-month implied volatilities for major Asian index options remain muted, finishing under 1 standard deviation below their 1-year averages again.  Skew remains elevated for HSI index options, closing close to the 75th percentile.  May 11 OTM Calls and Puts on the Nikkei 225 were the most actively traded options in Tokyo.  OTM April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng China Enterprise and April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng were the most actively traded options in Hong Kong.

**European Options**

* Risk premiums in options markets continue their decline with the VSTOXX currently at 14.7437 after closing last week at 15.2974.  If the VSTOXX closes at its current level, it will be the lowest final value in over 4 weeks.  Skew on 1-month Euro Stoxx v50 options is very cheap and currently sits below the 10th percentile for its 1-year average.  Such low Skew levels suggest there continues to be limited investor appetite for Euro Stoxx 50 Puts.  Options activity is limited to “macro” trades with OTM June 18 Calls, OTM December 19 Calls and Puts, and OTM April 20 Calls and Puts on the Euro Stoxx 50 are the most actively traded options in Europe.

**US Options**

* US options, pre-market, are implying a small drop in risk premiums with the VIX currently at 17.30 after closing last week at 17.41.  OTM April 20 Puts on SPY, OTM May 18 Puts on QQQ, April 20 OTM Calls on BAC, and July 18 OTM Puts on the NXPI are the most heavily traded options this morning.

I've even seen articles with headlines like ""AMZN *Expected* to *Surprise* on Earnings beat"". I know that's just the media pushing an agenda, but its also the sentiment I'm getting from people.

But how much hype is too much? Amazon is already up 3.00% as of right now.  Partly because of the sector-wide rally today, but also because people are already so convinced it's going to save the markets from this ""mini-correction"".

Realistically, if this much optimism is being priced in right now,  how fucking extraordinary does AMZN's ER have to be to push the stock significantly further up from here?

I know the market has the memory of a goldfish and quickly forgets about all the reasons they were scared into selling a week ago, but all of those problems are still there.  Tech is still the most overvalued sector, there is massive debt in the US, rate hikes ARE going to happen and everyone knows this bull run cant last forever.

Similar to netflix, Iqiyi is burning money to build a library of original content, however their original shows have tremendous production value and are already popular overseas in many Asian countries and even in theaters. In addition, If you want to watch Netflix originals in China, your only option is to use Iqiyi since they own an exclusive license to stream Netflix originals on their platform. With their earnings report today, I can honestly see this going to the moon.







Here are some numbers:




* 60 Million Subscribers (Half of Netflix's)
* Significant upside with 55% Sales Growth in 2017

2.

Volume is relatively low, but the market still went up today in light of all of this damning news.  

4. Without Trump, no more trade war tweets and no more Amazon tweets. The market will finally be stable. The tax bill has been passed. Trump's impeachment won't make that go away, so the market no longer needs Trump. In fact, Trump is now considered a liability.

**FORECAST**

**PPI (MoM) (Mar)**

Predicted: 0.3

Result: 0.3

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Yeah. This is getting fucking crazy. (7/7)

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Nope. This may be the most WTF thing I've ever done, but I'm kind of into it. There's more going on than I initially figured, but it all seems to be in the ""build-up"" stage. 

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

Whenever financial sites tend to have the same story on their front page, it's usually because the market's reacting to it, in some way. So, what's on Bloomberg? Trump potentially firing Mueller. What's on Marketwatch? ""Trump considering firing Rosenstein."" CNBC? ""Can blah blah blah fire Mueller?"" You see the theme here?

It sounds like the markets might be a little worried about Trump firing Mueller and/or Rosenstein. Lemme just check the futures real qui--LOL RED! It's 11:21 PM EDT, so the real test will be how they're looking in the morning, but there you go. Markets don't like uncertainty, and it's safe to assume that, when Trump finally goes beyond full-retard, and embroils us even deeper in a Constitutional crisis, people will run for the exits. 

Keep a close eye on how this pans out. I don't think it will happen tomorrow (hence no revisions yet), but considering Trump's timeline, he tends to wait for the time slot that will give him the best ratings. Maybe just assume it'll be whenever The Apprentice used to be on TV.

He can’t explain people that he doesn’t read your private messages. And the machines that do, help them identify padeofiles and criminals, to save people from such bad actors. In fact, Facebook does a lot of things to prevent such abuse that’s much easier on apps like Telegram.

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

**Core CPI (MoM) (Mar)**

Predicted: 0.2

Result: 0.2

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Not even close, baby. $SPY closed down $1.44, which means I can't even call it boring. First wrong guess. Mazel tov!

My record, so far: 7/8.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Now would be a good time to revise my guesses for the last two trading days of the week. Unfortunately, at least as of the time I'm writing this, I can't get a good read on what will happen tomorrow and Friday. Futures are trading too close to zero. No news yet from the White House. No news yet from anything, really, so we're probably going to be left high and dry, with nary a tube of lubricant, until Trump Tweets about suitcase nukes at 3:53 AM.

I might revise later tonight, assuming anything comes up, but once midnight hits, I'm locking myself out of any further revisions until after the close tomorrow.

There are 2 possible avenues for success if you follow my line of thinking. I will go over both in more detail below. The second play is more likely to succeed, but the potential gains are closer to 500% with the potential loss still 100%.

You can skip the first part if you don't care about this drug's background.

* **Background Information (you can skip this)**
---

Portola Pharmaceuticals ($PTLA) has a PDUFA date of May 4th for their blockbuster drug, Andexanet Alfa (AndexXa). A long time ago, I wrote a controversial ""hit piece"" against this company on Seeking Alpha; claiming that the drug was going to fail its FDA decision, which it did. The drug is promising, but PTLA cut way too many corners during their first attempt and didn't test for enough things. You can't cut corners when testing life-or-death kind of drugs. AndexXa is one of those life-or-death drugs. PTLA ran and wrote up the most loosely tied together study I've seen in a while for such an important drug, and they were served a CRL. This, to me, means the company has toxic and/or retarded upper management because no qualified professional would have recommended such a bare-bones approach. Just from reading it, you can tell upper management is cocky because they came across a blockbuster drug and felt that they couldn't possibly fuck it up. *Narrator: But they did.*

PTLA's next PDUFA was moved up from February of this year to May 4th. Bad news, right? Not exactly. AndexXa is one of those drugs that the FDA can't make a wrong decision on. I guess you could again point a finger at PTLA's management for handing them yet another unsatisfying trial, but we have no way of knowing that this time around. PTLA did not release a full study for their second decision, so I can't read it and know for sure.

The thing is, despite PTLA's seemingly earnest attempts to fail another FDA decision, AndexXa is such a strong drug that it would be hard for the FDA to say no again. AndexXa is sorely needed. The FDA could give AndexXa a Black Box Warning, only approving it for intracranial bleeding, and hospitals would still stock up on it as an essential drug. There will undoubtedly be tons of off-label use. I believe AndexXa *will* come with a Black Box Warning, with heavy limitations on its usage, but I also believe that it won't matter because there is no real alternative -- I predict that it may only be approved for treating Intracranial Hemorrhages. However, hospitals will use AndexXa regardless of the warnings, seeing as the only other option is death.

* **The Plays** 
---

I haven't even bought into these options yet, but I will over the course of this month, so you're all getting early access to my vast collection of knowledge. 

-

* 1000% or 0%

This is the dumbest play you could make here but also the most compelling one. For this play, you pour all of your money into **May 18 2018 50.00 Calls**. When and if AndexXa is approved, which I think will come with a harsh Black Box Warning, I believe PTLA will open at around $45/share. This will be much lower than expected had AndexXa instead come with a clean approval. But as positive sentiment rolls in, I believe that PTLA's price will rise from its opening price to at least $60/share as investors realize that Black Box Warnings don't matter for drugs like AndexXa. Institutional investors aren't stupid and I'm not a genius, so there might not be *any* negative sentiment and the price could just open up at $60+ in the first place. I'm not playing 4D chess here. 

Regardless, these calls are worth roughly $1 each now, so if underlying share price goes up to $60/share, they will go up to $10+ each. A gain of 1000% or more. Personally, I believe PTLA deserves to go up to around $80/share with approval of AndexXa, but that's just my personal belief and I can't vouch for an increase like that with certainty. 

-

* 500% or 0%

Same thing as above, but with an equal split between **May 18 2018 45.00 Calls** and **May 18 2018 40.00 Calls**. The loss here is still 100%. 

-

* More complicated plays for gains either way

There is no doubt some complicated options play here where you can bet for both sides, with a lean towards one end of the decision, and potentially come out with money either way. I'm not really about that life because I'm going in deep for an approval. But the potential is there for the less gambling-prone crowd.

&gt;The day’s decline was broad, with all 11 primary S&amp;P 500 sectors down on the day and 10 of them losing more than 1%.

* State of economy

&gt;The IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index hit a three-year high of 55.6 in March, up from 55.3. The ISM manufacturing report for the same month came in at 59.3, compared with a previous monthly reading of 60.8. A reading of 50 or above indicates improving conditions.

&gt;A reading on construction spending, meanwhile, inched up 0.1% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.27 trillion, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected growth of 0.3%, compared with an unchanged reading in January.

* Trade War

&gt;Trade policy continued to be in the forefront in the minds of investors. China announced tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% penalty slapped on U.S. pork and 15% on fruit. The news means China has made good on its threat to retaliate against the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports. 

&gt;“Today’s weakness has everything to do with China’s announced tariffs. Even though they were quite small, there’s a fear that this could escalate. We don’t know if this could be the end as far as retaliation goes, but it seems like the trade issue is escalating into bite and not just bark,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co.


* Tech Woes

&gt;Technology and internet stocks have also remained in focus, as the sector—still one of the stronger performing of the year—has undergone heavy volatility.

&gt;Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. also pointed to the weakness in tech and internet stocks as a main focus for investors. “You need to keep in mind that these stocks have had tremendous upward moves over the past year, but whenever the specter of Washington shines on an industry, you typically don’t get good performance. That’s what we’re seeing right now.”

* Apple isn't Tech

FinViz classifies it as consumer goods, not technology. It swings with the tech stocks still.

WH is shining light on big data and tech. AAPL just attacked Zuckercuk: [""Cook claimed the moral high ground, saying Apple ""could make a ton of money if we monetized our customers"" the way Facebook does. But he said he decided not to do it because it would violate the trust Apple has built with its fans.

It'll be a bit heavy on the math, then we'll turn it back to the finance.

Managing losses is an extremely valuable skill to have, especially for all you children out there gambling away daddy's trust fund and the few dollars you made sucking dick that one month.

Day 1: Suppose I have a stock trading at $100 today at open, then that stock loses 5% today. Now it is worth $95 at close, and we lost $5. Still with me? Dear god I hope so.

Day 2: At open your stock, is still at $95, we're assuming nothing happens pre- or post-market. Your stock drops another 5%. What is it worth now? It's worth fucking $90.25. Today we only lost $4.75.

Now wait, that's not a nice even number I'm used to. But why? Well losing money on the first day means that when you lose money on day 2, you're going to lose just a little bit LESS, in this case, 25 cents. The effect is even more dramatic at larger day 1 losses.

If we lost 10% the first day, then 10% the second day, we lose $10 on day one, and then $9 on day 2. Our savings are now a whole dollar now.

&gt; Okay okay /u/MuphynManIV my head hurts. So get to the point, what do all these numbers mean?

The takeaway here is that when you lose more on the first day, your losses thereafter will not be as bad. Exponential gains make you a ton of money really quick, while exponential losses actually get better over time.

Therefore, the strategy is not to time the market, buying selling and day trading until your dumb ass feels like you're getting a rhythm. Simply hold on to your shares and ride the anchor to the bottom, the losses get easier every day.",false,895oyl,,0,,false,1529537087,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/895oyl/managing_losses_a_wsb_story/,t3_895oyl,,,,

Off from actual results by 0.6, but the prediction was correct in that it was a miss, so I'll call this half-right. Also, some jackass updated the forecast after my original post.

Predicted: Red

I sold my WFC calls. I still have shares of WFC because I got them really cheap, but I sold my WFC FDs just a while ago for a nice profit. I never ended up buying XLF calls at open because my cousin and his wife are staying over so I had to make them tea and food, though if you did, you’re in the green. These XLF calls are *safe enough* to hold if you really want to. “Safe enough” means you won’t lose 100%, but you could still lose 50%-60% from its price as of right now. 

I sold my Amazon FDs for a 35% profit. I would’ve held onto them longer, but volume on the upswing later on in the morning was horrible. I still have quite a few May 18th 1600 calls that I bought Friday. I didn’t mention them in my thread because they’re not cheap. So I’m still bullish on Amazon, but not bullish enough to hold FDs on low volume. I suppose you could figure out a risky Amazon play on your own that isn’t as risky as FDs.

DD inside.,"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&amp;P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb. Ask mom to buy you a few less tendies this week and get you a WSJ sub instead) [Valuations for tech right now are insane](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true), and buying in right now seems to be typical WSB buy high sell low autism.
6. This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.
More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&amp;P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.
4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.

For any of these methods, I would buy in the next couple days. With today's gains, I feel like there are decent odds of a pullback. Look for buying opportunities. In any case, convert as much to cash as you can, and buy in NLT COB Wednesday, and you will see sweet gains by the end of Friday.",false,8b0imy,,0,,false,1529570340,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8b0imy/serious_this_is_the_week_for_gains_in_the/,t3_8b0imy,,,,

Equities are rallying after Friday’s sell-off even in the face of volatility out of Syria over the weekend, and continued concern over trade negotiations with China. Currently, the S&amp;P is up 1.8%, the Russell is up 1.13%, and the Nasdaq is up 2.5% and all are at or near highs for the day.  Bonds are off slightly on this risk on day with TLT -.33%. Gold is up slightly with GLD +.19%. Volatilities are lower though holding relatively firm given the market bounce with the VIX -4.4% to 20.54, RVX -5% to 20.55, and VXN -5.7% to 25.86. Overall activity is relatively muted though we are seeing generally bullish activity in the options market.

30% - Xi announces broad changes to Chinese trade policy that address US concerns.  This results in a 50% chance that Trump is satisfied and backs down and a 50% chance that Trump doesn't understand he's gotten the best deal possible and escalates regardless.

20% - Comrade Xi announces nationalization of all foreign and private assets, seizes all capital and sends the bourgeois to the gulags.

There's a lot of new people here, and a lot of young people here, and on online forums lying-as-memes gets taken seriously by the naieve and the stupid. So even though I'm a super fag for writing this gay shit, I'm going to break it down for you how you can increase your risk-taking. It's by being financially secure in 4 steps. Then you can blow whole paychecks on SPY calls. I've clawed my way out of legit stealing-electricity poverty and this is how you stay out.

1) Get a 1.5% cash back credit card, put your expenses on it, and here's the important part, *pay it off every fucking month so you don't pay interest.* This will give you like $400 bucks a year plus sweet perks like fraud protection and sometimes insurance.

2) Bundle your insurance for cheaper rates.

3) Put 3-6 months worth of bills in a fucking ALLY HIGH YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT. You FUCKING CUCKS joke about that shit all the time but when you smash your fucking car and need to get to work for a week, Robinhood will not be forthcoming on the bank deposits.

4) Start a ROTH *401k because tax rates won't get better. Ideally you max this bitch out with employer contributions but we want to leave money for TSLA losses so go for at least 2k a year.  EDIT: TO CLARIFY, Let your the fucking investment company handle this account. Don't look at it. Don't touch it. Check it twice a year for 30 years. Do a growth stocks mix if your're young, switch it to more bonds when you're older. Don't be the two retards in this thread with options enabled who treat this shit like a 2nd TD Ameritrade account. The account manager will do a healthy mix of growth stocks and other shit and you'll have a cool mil when you retire despite your fuckups here.

And that's it. Do this, THEN lose on options. This will keep you out of the god damn payday loan shop. You can keep eating chicken instead of peanut butter.

More importantly, you can take riskier plays because you're not worried about losing the money you need for fucking rent.",false,8b1rq8,,1,,false,1529570967,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8b1rq8/when_youre_broke_the_game_is_over/,t3_8b1rq8,,,,

The only thing Trump can do in response is bomb something, but that's not explicitly bad for the markets, unless he bombs North Korea.

Trump can't tweet about trade wars or Amazon with the investigation right at his doorstep. Stormy Daniels' lawyer is on MSNBC right now saying that he will almost assuredly get a deposition from Cohen and/or Trump now. This means Trump will be too preoccupied to fuck with the markets. Congress will not back Trump when it comes to tariffs because the optics are too bad with everything going on, and possibly even publicly go against him. Congress will also make moves to protect Mueller as Trump wants to fire Mueller real hard now. President Xi Jinping will see the writing in the sand and announce nothing big during his little announcement today because he knows Trump is about to go down and has no power to do anything to China.

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

No ""three-bull"" reports for today.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Boring

Results: I should probably define ""Boring."" When I make a ""Boring"" guess, I mean $SPY will close somewhere within +/- $1 of its opening price. Today, $SPY closed at $261.01 -- which means it closed $0.36 lower than its price at open. SO HAPPY MONDAY BOYZZZ! I'm right again!

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Based on my forecast, tomorrow's reports should either be meets or beats. No revisions yet.

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

I get that there's a fuckload of fear right now, but I'm under the impression that Trump has refocused on the newest shiny thing: the FBI just raided the *shit* out of his lawyer's office. This means it's reasonably likely that he won't open his stupid, fat gob about China while we're all trying to stop the bleeding. He's got other shit to wildly flail at right now.

Other things to look out for: China's tariff response. Don't expect the market to act like a little bitch this time, though. It might go red for a day (maybe two, although I doubt it), but we already know it's coming, so it shouldn't come as a shock unless our chubby little guys on Wall Street really are complete fucking morons. Here's the thing: China has more to gain by paying out more rope for Trump to hang himself. Why bloody your opponent's nose when you can tie a noose around his neck and goad him into running off of a 58-story building?

1) Keep the premium and nothing else happens

2) Keep the premium and are forced to buy 100 shares at the strike price

If Outcome 1 sell another put (repeat forever until Outcome 2). If Outcome 2 you now own 100 shares of the stock. Next step sell a covered call using your 100 shares at the same strike price your put was for. Possible outcomes are:

1) You keep your premium and you keep your shares (repeat forever until outcome 2)

2) You keep your premium but are forced to sell your shares for the same price you bought them for (go back to selling puts again)

Because your strike price is always the same you aren't ever losing or gaining money when buying/selling your 100 shares but you get to keep the premium in every step.

Headline: ""Expect a beat despite record revisions""

Key takeaways:

Bottom-up EPS revisions are up 5% compared to a typical 3-4% cut

17% YoY growth

Expect EPS growth peak in Q3 2018

7% YoY sales growth estimate (+9% in Q4 2017)

Oil prices and forex significant tailwinds

More expected guidance on capex spending from tax reform

40% of S&amp;P 500 companies plan more capex, 8% M&amp;A, 20% buybacks/dividends, 15% pay down debt, and 10% more R&amp;D.

Higher wages worth keeping an eye on this quarter. Potential margins squeeze if demand/pricing don't accelerate

Materials and industrial look best for earnings; real estate and utilities the worse

First time since 2011 that quarterly EPS revisions have been upwards in the months leading up to it; due to tax reform

https://i.imgur.com/BXMAnU5.png

https://i.imgur.com/PkExq2o.png

85% of ""early reporters"" have beaten on EPS, 77% on sales, and 62% beaten on both.

""Guidance Ratio"" (companies giving guidance prior to earnings either above or below consensus) is at 1 (equal). The long term average ratio is 0.6-0.7, pointing to optimism among management.

* Company beat on both EPS and sales during Q1
* Buy rating by BofAML

Q4 2017 Wrap

EPS was 4% above expectations and earnings growth 15% YoY strongest in six years. All sectors except energy beat

Sales beat by 1.5% (biggest in five years), and 9% YoY growth was strongest since 2011

68% of S&amp;P beat on EPS, 75% beat on sales, and 56% beat on both. The highest proportion since at least 2000. Tech, health care, and financials saw record EPS/sales beats.

&gt;TurboTax Online is equipped to handle around 500 individual transactions (give or take) per brokerage account **before the performance starts to deteriorate.**

&gt;If you need to enter a bunch of stock transactions with a total sales volume of less than $10,000,000 (ten million), you can enter a summary for each sales category. Instructions follow.

&gt;Another alternative is to switch to the TurboTax CD/Download software which handles around 2,000 individual transactions per brokerage.

##TLDR; if you make more than 2000 trades in a year just kill yourself

This, in turn, leads to all kinds of silly ideas about manipulation or pinning strikes which people use as excuses for their shit trading results and detracts from the overall quality of this sub. The concept itself is really fucking simple so let's just cover it and get it out of the way. 


**Market Making**

Ever exchanged local currency to FX? They usually have a bid/ask spread that they're willing to buy and sell the currency for and it's usually quite wide. That's their market, and that's them making it. Let's use a yacht for our example since it's easier to learn concepts through abstraction and a yacht will never be a part of any of your realities. 

So say there is a yacht that we think is worth $500k. A market maker will show something like a $450k bid and a $550k offer, so the market is 450k @ 550k. Say someone hits his bid and sells it to him for 450k. What happens next is that the market maker will now move his valuation of the yacht to better reflect his inventory position. So instead of saying the yacht is worth $500k, he will say I just bought it for $450k, let's make that the new theoretical price. So now, making the same $100k wide market as before, he'll show a $400k bid and a $500k offer. The idea is to aggressively look to trade out of the risk of owning the position. If someone comes along and decides to pay him $500k for his yacht, the market maker has just scalped it for $50k and is now flat risk which is the perfect outcome for him. He will move his valuation of the yacht back to $500k and rinse and repeat.

What happens if instead someone hits his bid again and sells him the yacht for $400k? The market maker will retreat his valuation again, show a market of $350k @ $450k and be long 2 yachts. Living the fucking dream. But he has the risk of owning 2 yachts now and needs to get out. You'll notice he's now selling a yacht for the same price he bought the first one for. We call that a **scratch**. What happens if his $350k bid gets hit again? He's now got 3 yachts and shows a market of $300k @ $400k. So now he's selling a yacht for less than the what he bought the first yacht for. We call that a **hack**. Hacking fucking hurts and means you've traded poorly. 

So what happens if people just keep hitting the market maker's bid? At some point he owns an entire fucking fleet of yachts and he's retreated his valuation for each one all the way down to $50k. He's lost an insane amount of cash buying all the way down and owns every yacht in the harbour. We call that **getting run over**. This happens a lot in markets, where order flow will push valuations one way, and any market maker who's silly enough to stand in front of the freight train gets run the fuck over. This is why the idea that market maker's manipulate pricing is really stupid, that's just not how markets operate.

**Pinning**

Another dumb idea is that market makers trade deltas to force option strikes to pin on expiry. Say a market maker owns the ATM straddle, so he's long gamma. If the underlying ticks up, his gamma gets him longer deltas and vice versa if the underlying ticks down. So on upticks the market maker is looking to sell deltas as his hedge and buy deltas on downticks. This means that every single time he trades a future he is naturally 'pushing' the future back onto his long strike, so his trading pattern is more conducive to the future pinning his own long strike. 

It's the same thing if he is short the straddle. Short gamma on upticks means he has to buy deltas and sell them on downticks, so this time he's 'pushing' the future away from his short strike. To try and make it pin his short, he'd have to sell deltas as he got shorter and buy them as he got longer which is the cardinal sin of market making known as **texas hedging**. Many fresh-faced traders have fucked this up and lost money. Some even lose their jobs because it costs their firms so much. When you're getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to trade with someone else's money, the last thing you want to do is risk your job trying to force a pin on your short strike just to earn a couple of bucks of pnl. 

So now that we all know the simplest form of market making, can we stop with the silly ideas about them? You guys hurt my feelings sometimes.",false,8fr4gl,,0,,false,1529656195,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8fr4gl/basics_of_market_making/,t3_8fr4gl,,,,

Once you find the car you want on Carvana they will deliver it to your home where you can test it out for the trial period and return it if you are not satisfied. The whole idea sounds great, buying a car from the comfort of your home, but there is a looming problem.

Carvana’s share price has seen tremendous growth this year with a 52 week low of 8.14 and current price of 28 dollars per share. This comes on the back of the acquisition of Car360. Car360's brings 3D computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technologies to Carvana. The goal of this acquisition is to enhance Carvana's 360-degree photo technology capabilities. One of the most important parts of selling a car online is being able feel like you are there in front of the car, which is a big problem for Carvana. Many people have reported finding scratches and other defects once they receive their car. Maybe this acquisition can help the buyer check for defects before delivery. There are several other problems Carvana is facing, such as rapidly expanding losses and recent news of dilution, but in this article, I will focus solely on what I see as the Iceberg that can bring down the ship.

All you need to purchase a car from Carvana is to make 10,000 dollars a year. That’s it, there is no minimum credit score. This is why the vast majority of the cars sold from Carvana are subprime or even deep subprime. Subprime is historically defined as a credit score under 600. While subprime loans can be very lucrative due to the very high interest rate return, we are reaching a tipping point.

More pressure is being put on subprime lenders as interest rates continue to rise. Summit Financial a subprime car finance company, recently went into bankruptcy due to loans that turned bad. Spring Tree Lending, another subprime lender was forced into bankruptcy after being accused of misrepresenting the amount of losses it was taking on. Pelican auto finance a deep subprime lender shut down last month after losses began to mount.

Private equity firms and banks have starting tightening their lending standards to subprime and deep subprime markets as delinquencies pick up. The aforementioned examples of subprime lenders winding down does not mean Carvana will meet the same fate but there could be trouble ahead.

Carvanas relationship with its biggest lender Ally Financial, who extended 2 billion in financing to Carvana last year, could be in jeopardy. Ally Financial recently announced key leadership changes to its auto finance, insurance and risk management organizations, with President Tim Russi stepping down. The question remains if the new leadership will continue to pursue a strong relationship with Carvana or start to limit its risk in the subprime sector. Another company who is vital to Carvana is Drivetime, which is the company who spun off Carvana. In January Drivetime CEO Ray Fidel stepped down as the company’s losses continued to grow. With new leadership at two of Caravans main supports and losses in the sector picking up its relationship with the two could be in danger. 

As interest rates, delinquency, and losses continue to rise lending to the subprime and deep subprime market becomes less advantageous. Key support could be pulled out from Carvana, resulting in difficulties offloading its subprime loans and finding financing.

Additional notes: 
President of Credit Acceptance Corp (a large subprime auto lender), Steven Jones announced his retirement two weeks ago amid a time of regulatory scrutiny from states and increased risk in the lender’s portfolio.

But now things are hit in Syria again, and what better ""sorry I forgot to get you a gift Melina"" than a delivery of tomohaks IN YOUR NAME, to men ~~women and children~~ in need.

With Donny  ""thumb on the trigger"" Trump in the White House I think we can see a few strategic stiles in our future.

So here is the DD. The war on terrorism is huge, Raytheon is a solid contractor with a solid growth record. There are some fun rumors of a stock split right now too. But if Donny pulls the trigger we should be set. If not maybe less than 40%, but you can still sell the option later down, a couple months but on a bull run. You're still fine.

Stock split? No problem, now you have twice as many options at half the target price!




Yeah so 1350% is Jan 2019 calls at $240 price. $3.73 per option. Stock in theory hits $295 (40% gains at current price of $211 in a little under a year.

(Sell price - break even price) = profit
($295 - 244)*100 shares) = $5100 

(Profit/cost)*100= %gained
(5100/373)*100=1367%

Lets be real here, Tariffs take a while to implement and a while to take effect. youre talking at least 1 year.

2) Tariffs right now only account for maybe 1% of all trade. Thats very little.

3) Even if theres a shit storm of trade wars...you can reasonably expect maybe a 50% drop...so Knowing that outcome you can have some cash avail.

4) china and the us are not dumb. Eventually they will reconcile and the recovery will happen from there.


whats unlikely: Trade war persists. Theres no reconciliation. Massive loss of jobs due to less consumption. Global economy crashes and enters depression. world war 3. companies leave the US for greener pastures. If this happens...you probably have more to worry about than the 5k you just lost 50% of.

And even if this happens, youll still have 50% of your cash remaining to take advantage of this move. 

Take this as an opportunity to buy the market at a 7 to 10% discount. At least a small percentage.

Based upon the following DD, I propose buying calls with an expiration of July (strikes of $2 and $3 are interesting):

* Alexa growth is up for BlueApron.com in Q1: https://twitter.com/Adriyayy/status/980861948773457920
* Sales of nearly $1B, market cap of just over $330M. Annual net loss of $200M but should be improving into Q1.
* It is only trading at about ~1.5x cash in the bank. Room to fall is low.

That article is what caused all of this, as well as an investigation by the department of Justice. This sounds risky as shit, but I know we have all yolo'd on dumber shit, let's be real. The President of Ticketmaster released this statement, and denied everything: https://insider.ticketmaster.com/ticketing-vertical-integration-and-the-nyts-recent-article/. What could go wrong?
 
Basically what happened was, Livenation got butthurt a venue was using AEG for tickets on a show, instead of using Ticketmaster, and retaliated by moving the concert to a LYV owned venue instead. This is not legal at all, and could be very bad for LYV of course. Who is buying this dip with me? For the record, I am down 30% on my LYV calls that I got this morning, I caught the knife, but I am not worried to be honest. 

Just did some actual DD as well-

The concert was for Matchbox Twenty, who was touring with Goo Goo dolls that year (I can't confirm if that was for this concert, though), thats easily a venue with a capacity of 20k+, the venue they were booked at originally was the Gwinnett Center, which only holds 13,000. LYV moving concerts happens A LOT, and within a short period as well. If a show is selling good or bad, they will move it to a more appropriate venue. BUY THE DIP.

I work in this industry, so I have a pretty good idea on how many people a band can bring to a venue, as well as how often shows get moved around. Lyv alleges thats why they moved the show, so me posting this part matters, since it can prove why the show got moved.

In 2014, operating loss was -22M on 105M of revenue. In 2017, they have an operating loss -49M on 673M of revenue; -35M net income. Is operational profitability in sight? No, 2018 expectations guide a GAAP loss of -100M on 980M of revenue. In 2014, 105M of revenue out of GMV of 3.7B is 2.79%; this is a rate to look at profitability of the Shopify platform. Being a new company, I'd say those are good numbers. We can look at Etsy which has a much better platform profitability. Esty's 2017 GMV is 3.2B, and they made 441M of revenue on that volume which is a rate of 13.56%. Shopify's numbers in 2014 are much earlier in their business, so maybe they don't fully reflect the profitability possibilities of the platform. However, 2017 doesn't get much better. Shopify's 2017 GMV totaled 26.3B. How much did they make on the volume? 673M. That's 2.56%, even worse than three years ago. Revenue/GMV gradually declines, Ebay's was 18% just five years ago and sits around 10% today. This is fine, but making only 2.56% on a platform that just opened is dismal. Ebay makes 9.7% on 84B of GMV today. They are different platforms to Shopify, but it still doesn't excuse Shopify's lack of profitability.**



While Shopify prides itself on organic growth, they spent 226M on Sales and Marketing, which is 34% of their revenue, to bring more users on their platform. How the hell are they reporting positive EPS? Great question.


They have funded their entire business through dilution and sale of stock. It's a staggering amount of cash flow they are burning through to attempt to achieve profitability. Proceeds from their most recent stock sale totaled 560M. They go and spend these proceeds on marketable securities. I calculated this by doing the math of the cash flow. If you add the proceeds of sale of stock from 2017 and the gains from maturity of marketable securities, (560M + 642M), you get 1,200M in positive cash flow. They spent 1,129M on marketable securities this year. Lets do the math from 2016: (224M + 140M) = 364M, marketable securities purchased in 2016 was 369M. While yes this is smart, it's creating the illusion of a profitable business model. Additionally, they are paying their employees in stock. This is where it gets interesting.


On Yahoo Finance, Shopify's TTM EPS is +0.15. That's a Non-GAAP number though. Their true earnings are -0.42 for their EPS, which includes employee expense. The expense of paying employees in stock is allowed to be subtracted from earnings through a non-gaap measure, and this is what they report. Quote from most recent quarterly report, Q417, on 2018 outlook to explain this: [""GAAP operating loss in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Adjusted operating income4 in the range of $(5) million to $5 million, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes of $100 million""](https://s2.q4cdn.com/024715446/files/doc_financials/2017/q4/Press-Release-Q4-2017.pdf) If you check their Q4 reports, you can see the changes to GAAP measures. They added +0.51 EPS for stock based compensation and +0.06 EPS for payroll taxes related to stock based compensation. Obviously, paying employees is an expense, but they get ommit it from their earnings per share by reporting in non-gaap measures. Pretty crazy. 



Here's a summary of operations:


* Platform produces 2.56% of revenue on the volume of product that goes through.
* Spend 30%+ of revenue on advertising to bring more users to grow GMV, which grows revenue.
* Large operating losses are reported as positive earnings by subtracting employee costs through stock compensation.
* Operating losses further offset by huge cash flow of sale of stock.
* Sale of stock cash flow is almost entirely used on purchasing marketable securities.
* Using the further sale of stock and maturity of securities to fund their further operating losses.
* Operating losses are growing YoY.
* Report positive EPS to look like it's a profitable business model.


Atleast they don't have debt right? Well, the investors paying for their stock are paying for more operational losses, with no profitability in sight. Even if SHOPs GMV skyrockets to 100B, they would only be producing maybe 2.5B in revenue. Even then, operating expenses have always exceeded gross profit historically for SHOP. With no sign of operational expense slowing down, great revenue growth numbers won't do much for them. Eventually, I see sentiment turning around as operating losses grow and investors arn't seeing a return. Maybe 2018 will be better? Nope.


Forcast for 2018:

* Revenue of 970M-990M
* GAAP operating loss in the range of $95 million to $105 million (200% increase in loss from 2017's -35M)
* Adjusted operating income4 in the range of $(5) million to $5 million, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes of $100 million


This shows GMV growing by 50%, which is great, but GMV growth is slowing drastically. In 2017, GMV growth was 71%, 2016 99%, 2015 105%. GMV growth is slowing while ad spend is growing, that's a worrying trend. Overall, I think SHOP's lack of profitability historically and forecasted shows weakness in the equity.

I was a huge bear and panic sold at the bounce back after the first huge dip. I just went all in again, 70k stocks 30k options split evenly between QQQ/SPY/FB. 

I might get my asshole ripped open but pretty sure this will all blow over. 

Can you imagine what another financial collapse would look like in the US, when people are so highly partisan and radicalized on BOTH sides? We basically have a new class of people in this nation, on BOTH sides, that are dedicated activists, 24/7. This country is a powder keg. Things were calm and peaceful politically back in 2007/8 compared to how they are now. Everyone was drugged up on ""Hope and Change"", willing to be patient and let it play out, see how Obama handled the situation. 

But now? Carnage in the streets. Martial law in all major cities. National Curfew. Calls for the impeachment of our president. Constitutional Crisis. It would last for months or years if we suffered a prolonged trade war that devastated our economy. It would be EXACTLY THE SAME THING in China. Potential for governmental collapse, or such a radical change in either society that it could be considered a new entity. 

It wont happen. Just chill bros. I'm betting (literally) we will see new highs before June in QQQ.

Nothing has been implemented. and dont even think it will be, and just looks like noise now.

Because if the Tariffs go into effect- 100% the market will crash and lead to another recession. 

Probably 10-20% drop. ( just the talk of it is causing the markets(dow) to have 3% swings)

And that will be detrimental to not just US economy but the entire world.

""Legacy thinking at best - UBS fails to understand the fundamental changes which have occurred in the memory and, especially, storage sectors.  Forward thinking people perceive the sectors as now almost entirely dominated by a disciplined oligopoly with extremely high entry barriers combined with at least steady growth of memory demand and high growth of storage demand.  This will not abate - cyclically is, by any significant measure, a thing of the past and will not recur for the foreseeable future and longer.  And neither sector is commodity in nature now, nor ever will be again.

UBS’s thinking appears to be grounded in past times when personal computers dominated demand for memory and storage and numerous fabricators with only modest entry barriers addressed the demand, thus causing the technology to appear to be commodity in nature.  Those times are utterly over and absolutely won’t return - demand drivers are now dramatically more broad, robust, and accelerating with no end in sight, fabrication technology is immensely more advanced and thus entry barriers are extremely high, and the fabrication family shrank to a quite small and well disciplined oligopoly which has consistently demonstrated wise restraint of fabrication facility growth.

Memory is necessary as a matter of processing logistics.  But whether based upon carbon, iron oxide, silicon, or chalcogenide, all knowledge resides in storage.  Including AI knowledge.  And in the inherently competitive Universe we reside within you simply can’t know too much.  So as AI expands the demand for storage will expand even faster.  And Strong AI (https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) will consume storage insatiably.  And this storage sector reality will become increasingly clear as the investing community learns that storage is absolutely key to broad and dramatic technology change - change which is defining the lives and fortunes of all people, corporations, institutions, and even sovereign nations on this planet.

On 21 May 2018 Micron will hold an analyst and investor event (http://Investors.Micron.com/?_ga=2.59001453.1182497785.1522947257-1574198886.1475610820).  In my estimation the firm will espouse absolutely solid confidence in their near and long term future in both memory and storage.  And that won’t be the only counter to this myopic UBS analysis - contrary opinions will flow from the vast majority if not all credible observers in the meantime.

Micron, with a 5.79 P/E, leader of the pack technology position in storage, and superbly growing demand firmly rooted in fundamental planetary technology acceleration, is an investor’s dream come true - already superb stock price growth notwithstanding it will continue to rise at a substantially greater rate than the broad market as the new realities of the memory and storage sectors become increasingly clear to everyone and the firm's performance metrics continue their confident march higher.  Those who study this landscape carefully and have solid technology credentials already perceive this.  And enlightenment will spread as Micron’s realities become increasingly undeniable.

In my opinion this UBS downgrade is at best incompetent, should be viewed as such, and, as the comments already offered here indicate, will be viewed as such by the broader technology and investing community.

It’s almost impossible for some to perceive change even as it’s occurring and accelerating.  But even myopic eyes will eventually be forced to acknowledge reality.  But in the meantime the portfolio of anyone who follows such myopic observers will have suffered terribly...""",false,8a84hd,,0,,false,1529556323,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8a84hd/mu_dd_srs/,t3_8a84hd,,,,

- US companies operating in China can face more regulation (e.g. Apple)

- Beijing has history of banning group travel to Philippines, Japan, and South Korea, depriving them of revenue. 

- China stepped up consumer boycotts and inspections by regulars to South Korea last year, causing enough lost revenue that they had to close down some stores (Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/lotte-retreats-from-china-as-beijing-seoul-dispute-dents-business-1505389800)

As a whole - I think this ends up getting settled without any tariffs being placed and I believe that Trump (yes, that fucking idiot) does have the upper hand. 

US does have a massive trade deficit with China, but when you look at it on a value added basis, it is around half of the 350B stated number. This puts a cap on what the US can tariff until then end up just harming themselves. You can't tariff the iPhone. The US value add portion is closer to 85%, so lets just say most of it. If you look at the 2016 % breakdown, the largest exports are Planes (9%), Cars (~9%), Semis (6.5%), Soybeans (~10%). 

Now I think you guys know Soybeans were included in the last retaliation round from China. This was strategically picked. China loves their fucking Soybeans, it is a huge export, they get more tonnage from Brazil and the prices  should adjust according to market pressures that dictate commodities. Ex. Shortage of soybeans, prices rise, futures prices rise, crops are shifted from lower priced to higher, prices stabilize. It also directly attacks Trump's voter base. 

Cars were also included. Now GM and Ford did 4m units last year in China, not a huge market and there was already a 25% tariff, so this brings it to 50%. You probably don't even lose all those units now as people were already paying through the nose to have a US vehicle. 

Planes was limited to smaller body planes from Boeing, ones that take up a tiny sliver of the backlog. China knows they can't shift orders, both Airbus and Boeing are backed up for years. This is an idle threat, China needs those planes. 

And thats most of the 50B proposed. If they want to match the other 100B Trump is threatening, that is pretty well the rest of the total imports. We've already said they likely won't move any orders for planes - so they either pay up or fuck off. Semiconductors are needed for all modern tech infrastructure, something that China is a leader in and their is no good substitutes for Intel and NVidia in datacenter. They could shift memory buying away from Micron, but again as it is a commodity this would just shift sales around. WFE equipment for their semi build out includes critical US companies, and the US could choke out any expansion they want.  I would argue that this is actually one of the areas they could best narrow the deficit. Qualcomm is a wildcard here as China may take out their frustrations on them through blocking the NXPI merger out of spite, or the Chinese manufacturers join Apple in not paying Qualcomm for licensing. 

So if we leave out those critical US goods that China needs, they need to get pretty fucking punitive to cause real damage while the US is 20% of total exports for China. 

In the short term, this is extremely damaging. Most of what is happening the market is a compression of the multiple beginning to price a decline in global growth, and EPS estimates being revised as Capex and investment slows due to uncertainty. But most of this attacks Trump's voter base, and he is looking to look like a hero. I would expect more escalation, before it is done but he will eventually realize the long term damage, make a deal, twist the numbers, and look like a hero to his base of voters. 

Good luck everyone. 

Little update:

Top whipping boys:
Apple - Unlikely, brings too many jobs. 
GM - already happened, incrementally a problem.
Qualcomm - Biggest risk in my opinion. 
Boeing - Unlikely to do further. 
Broadcom - Unlikely, Singapore company formerly, very critical components.
TXI - yes a risk, more legacy tech. 
Micron - Yes a risk.
Nike - would be very unpopular to do so in China. 
Applied Materials - Unlikely. Critical to semi capacity build out.

original question  “so what’s the EPS looking like for the upcoming quarter?”

My friend's rephrasing: Something about Wall Street something something projections.

WMT: *explanation of what went wrong last q and why it'd go up.*

editor's note: Girl next to me had her hand on my leg, I don't fully remember everything word for word.

----
Question: ""AMD?""

Rephasing: ""IOT?""

WMT: We current have partnerships with Tencent to something something data science. We also own 10% of JD.*

Editor's note: Not sure if Walmart owns 10% of JD or him and other people sitting there own 10%. Probably Walmart, I'd give it a 90% chance.


----
Original question: ""Wage increase""
Walmart: Tax reformed lowered our tax from 33% and 23%. Rather than doing share buyback we rose wages to $11.50 because *something something accounting this is better for company.*

Editor's note: Basically, whenever I used italics, blame it on blonde sorority chicks.


-----
Orginal question: ""Walmart’s future plans for an Uber partnership.""
WMT: *something about working with locals and getting them to deliver for us. Towers rather than lockers? Something about that*


----
Original question: ""How do you compete with Amazon.""
Walmart: *Something about maintaining originality. It's important to have differences. They're using machine learning and AI more though. I think he said Alibaba at some point.*



TLDR: Long $JD, target price $90. Long $0700 too.

We need to calm down and try to keep things in perspective. Yes, Trumps decision on trade tariffs will cause pain but the economy is plenty strong to weather the storm. Look at your 2 year chart. Under Trump we are up 42%. Yes, be prepared to see losses in the near future but it’s temporary. Keep your eye on the big move. 


Money drives the market. Not news on trade wars. Stocks are driven by people buying more than people sell. The same is true for the market in general. When money pours into the market, it goes up. Yeah magic! This makes people want to get in on the action, they in turn put money into the market to reap the gains - driving the market higher. 


The point is news is temporary and if the news doesn’t affect the “buyer” directly - than its not worth a squirrel fart. The notion that ‘this’ news story won’t fade and buyers will think “omg but what about the trade war with China” is over reactionary. This will fade and as long as our economy remains strong, we will continue up. 


Lastly, volatility.  Not sure about you guys but the volatility has created a lot of good opportunities. Don’t be greedy. Get in. Get out. Let’s stop being emotional. Let’s keep things in perspective. Let’s make some money.

[Ref. original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88injx/us_economic_results_4218_4618/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

**ADP Nonfarm Employment Change**

Predicted: 219.9

Result: 241 -- Higher than predicted, but a beat v. forecast is still a beat. I'm correct in that regard, but still technically wrong. My prediction was still better than their forecast, though. They suck so many dicks at forecasting.

**ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI**

Predicted: 59.0

Result: 58.8 -- lower than predicted, but close enough that the markets didn't take the news as negative. Strictly speaking, I'm wrong on this one.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Green. This is getting a little weird.

**Any revisions?**

No revisions yet.

Full disclosure: I buy puts (monthlies) when we have rallies like today's. However, since there aren't any ""important"" reports tomorrow, I don't see a good reason to call Thursday red yet. Friday is also looking good, but again, coming from where we were this morning, you'd have to be retarded to think there's boundless optimism right now. Keep your shit tight, don't overextend your liquidity, and BE PATIENT.

Finally, keep a close eye on external factors. The news is talking about Mueller a lot more than it did in the last few weeks, and the articles have a lot more ""juice"" in them than before. Other things to keep in mind are: Trump's not done with his tariff shit and the GOP is increasingly nervous about a ""blue wave"" in November (so expect them to finally rein-in the POTUS and/or go full retard). Don't you miss the days when politics didn't figure into the market? I sure as fuck do.

**Anything else?**

I feel like I should go to bed soon, but part of me really wants some buttermilk tenders from McDonald's.

One. innnnn twoo WEEKS!.... Believe me. It is a fact. We are going to the moon... with our marines. Ok? Space marines..Listen, the failing Amazon has nothing to offer... We talking clouds people. Clouds.. in the sky. Where it rains from. Bing Bing Bong Bing Bong Bong Bing Bing Bing. The smart people at Microsoft. Very smart people. Okay? They are putting computer servers up there. How? We just... dont know. But its all floating up there. I ask my colleges how? Its a miracle. Everybody is switching to this new technology as its tremendous. Cheaper, reliable and effective. And Microsoft is growing these clouds in the sky at 2 to 3 times the rate over low energy Bezos' Amazon. Clouds are the heavens folks, thats where jesus is. My evangelical fans know what I am talking about.

Companies are sick of hiring so many unfuckable dweebs in IT. Want to downscale overhead, ok? Cloud lets 'em do this folks. Less dweebs, less cost, more reliability and efficiency. Whats not to like? And what do companies who haven't moved to the cloud all have? Servers belonging to Microsoft. Who do you think they are more likely to transition to in 2018 as first timers? Especially now when the last batch of windows server 2012 (like wives) are running out of warranty. There good years are behind them. And they need to be replaced... Who do you think they will move to? some guy who sells dildos online? Or dorky four eyes who have been doing this since the very start? 2 to 3 times folks, 2 to 3 times the growth rate. Do I say anymore? Bezos is a loser. Period. Even his little cloud has Microsoft operating systems running on it. Does Microsoft clouds have AWS on it? No. That's what I call Microsoft First folks. Thats the kind of protectionism this country deserves.

Office 365 is unmatched. Exchange is unmatched. These are the draws for cloud in 2018 for first timers, if the company is big. Mid. Small. Doesn't matter. Ok? And low energy Bezos does not even offer similar services to compete with these, hes a infrastructure only cloud guy... One trick pony. Nothing exciting. ""But what about google?"" They ask. I already said it folks. Bing Bing Bing. It has the best porn search, Period. Just click video and type your gay porn search. See for yourself. Tremendous catalog of pornstars. In fact I found my last date, Miss Daniels, using it. The same one the failing Washington post always talks about.... But they ask me, what about google docs? G Suite? Gay Drive? Its nothing folks, just a tool for edgy failing companies who want to show how different they are by going against the great people of america. They are losers. Period.

And did you hear about this.... eye....ohhh...teee? Its the future. Microsoft about to go 5 Bill'ian deep in this. TOASTER!!!!!!! Your toaster will be a smart toaster now, it will tell you the weather and read you text messages while heating up that delicious bread. Its unbelievable what these knuckleheads are doing.

And that Xbox... oh, I dont like that very much. The violence. Its so bad. Guns dont kill peope, Master Chief does. SAD. But its okay! Its okay. As you know, I am a reasonable person. Very reasonable. I see this is just a small portion of their business, so I will let it go. Ok? And with internet speeds improving and cloud technologies improving. Who is to say the next xbox wont just be a service on your smart TV like netflix. You connect a controller in to the TV and BAM! open your xboxflix and select the game thats maintaining your virginity. Just. Like. That. Failing sony gaystation will have to get a third party cloud host. Maybe microsoft can help them with that.

Arm chips, I also have tremendous arms. And hands. No problem folks. But Arm chips, the main chip inside every phone today. It is coming to windows 10...laptops.........But they ask ""Why? Why would Microsoft want to put phone chips on a computer. They already have intel chips."" Listen folks, like michael jackson's younger days, microsoft had a darker past. Before the light took over, they tried selling phones in a market already dominated by a hippy asshole &amp; those patent-less andriod clowns at google. Hard to get in to a market with a different operating system without flappy bird. Unacceptable. But listen to this, you wouldn't believe it. if you make laptops that use the same chip as the phone chip. Now we talking. The apps can be created for the laptops first! Ok? So that when your potential microsoft phone comes out, it is a simple change folks. All the apps are there. No handicaps. Nothing. This is how winners do it. This hidden agenda was revealed to me by the one trusted news source today, Info Wars with the host Alex Jones. Terrific guy. The deep state wants you to believe its just for longer battery life. Just more news by the fake media.

Windows 10, hit the start menu. Have a look. Look at those boxes... if you never changed them since inception. i mean just look at them. You see those ads in your start menu? When they did start coming in? Did 7 have it? No Did windows 8? No. Did Windows 9 have it? No. That red dot between his eyes of a CEO of microsoft is a very clever guy. Watch this. Just listen. He gives out his operating system for free folks. Ok? Like some Bernie Sanders commie. But really... he's just a crooked Hillary in disguise. Nobody saw that coming. Offers a software upgrade for free so that everybody can get a new operating system BUT with ad revenue making endless money! Some of you losers still have windows 7. You paid for it once and that is it. If for those 5 years you hold windows 10, even on the 5th year Microsoft will get money. Genius folks! Genius. Not as genius as me but still genius. I can respect that. Ok? And Microsoft HQ leaked that they love harassing woman, I can respect that too. Ok?

Linkedin! The social media of suits. Where the level of cuckism is so high, you cant even send dirty messages to the hot babes on there. It used to just be a social media for your employers to stalk you but over the years it has been the platform for finding jobs. Companies pay to have their ads on it. Believe me this record low unemployment rate wouldn't be possible without it. And they now offer classes that are subscription based for learning. I never read, I dont need to. My gut gives me all the information I need on any subject. But for those of you losers with a shitty gut. It is the future. The losers at Pluralsight wont be able to complete. That failing company is trying to actually go public. Ok? Hoping to achieve the success of SNAP. While a social media app with millions and meelins and meeeelins and meeeelins of suits offers the same service now. Its a no brainer folks. The future will be here as well.

CHiana can try to punch back to our fair trade policies. Whether its wine, soy beans, you name it. They can make their own iphones. Even make low energy Bezo's ecommerence stores. But do you know what they cant do? make a windows operating system. I rest my case.

And if SP500 goes to say 1500, you still collect your premium and can sell calls for 1500 for Dec 2021 and get 9% or whatever % again. Rinse and Repeat.

Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with these writings, these seem to be Trump's playbook on China, as we have seen some play out or are in the pipeline.

""Federal law should require all online retailers to clearly display the country of origin labeling information for all of their products.""

""Congress should require all food and drug producers to clearly label the countries of origin for all major ingredients that go into a product—and do so in a standardized and legible manner.""

""Finally, it is important to view this not as a “Made in the USA” statement but rather as a “Made in the Free World” campaign. Real free trade without the kinds of mercantilist and protectionist practices that characterize China can be a good thing. Great products coming from our real free trade partners like Japan, Mexico, and Germany improve our lives and contribute to our mutual prosperity. We need these countries on board the “real free trade” agenda and ready to share the burden of sanctioning a mercantilist and protectionist China whenever that becomes necessary.""

""That’s why we need much tougher laws that clearly assign blame to any American wholesaler or retailer selling a Chinese product that ultimately harms someone here in America. More accountability will force retailers to find a way to push the liability back to where it actually belongs or make other choices when they stock their shelves.""

""The simplest and most effective legislative cure for China’s mercantilist and protectionist ways—and one that avoids direct confrontation because it need not mention China directly by name—is for Congress to pass the “American Free and Fair Trade Act.” This Act would set out the following ground rules—with appropriately tough sanctions for failing to play by them:
Any nation wishing to trade freely in manufactured goods with the United States must abandon all illegal export subsidies, maintain a fairly valued currency, offer strict protections for intellectual property, uphold environmental and health and safety standards that meet international norms, provide for an unrestricted global market in energy and raw materials, and offer free and open access to its domestic markets, including media and Internet services.""

""That’s why as a companion action to passage of the Free and Fair Trade Act, the United States must partner with Europe, Brazil, Japan, India, and other victims of China’s mercantilism and protectionism to petition the World Trade Organization for full compliance of its rules by China. Only by strength through numbers will the U.S. and others succeed in bringing a now “beggaring thy neighbor” China into a true community of free trading nations.""

"" the first best option to bring about a fairly valued Chinese currency may be found in some top secret “shuttle diplomacy.”
To this end—and this is an extremely urgent matter!—the White House should immediately send a secret emissary to inform the Chinese Communist Party of this: The United States will have no other choice than to brand China a currency manipulator at the next biennial Treasury Review and impose appropriate countervailing duties unless China strengthens its currency to fair value on its own.
In this discussion, America’s emissary should make it clear that the United States would much prefer that currency reform be “China’s idea,” not that of the United States; and that in no way does the United States wish for China to “lose face” on this issue. In fact, that is why this mission must be conducted in total secrecy.""

""Of course, if China fails to act in a timely manner, the Department of the Treasury must follow through on branding China a currency manipulator and impose appropriate defensive duties to bring the Chinese yuan to fair value.""

""Because of the importance of this issue, we must also consider legislation that would prevent our firms from entering into deals with China that require any such technology transfers as a condition of market access.""

""To ensure that China does not benefit from such predatory economic warfare, Congress should pass legislation that blocks any Chinese media and Internet firms that engage in censorship from raising funds from the U.S. stock markets""

""Because of the strategic threat from foreign governments gaining control of American private industries, the U.S. Congress should pass legislation preventing domestic private firms from entertaining offers from state-owned enterprises, whether they are Chinese, Russian, or otherwise.""

“To counter this equally clear and present danger, we must radically staff up and beef up our dedicated China counterintelligence efforts—and coordinate this work with our allies in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.”

“As for appropriate penalties, spying for China by an American citizen is treason—the highest crime against our country. It should be punishable by life imprisonment and, in cases involving military and defense secrets, it should result in execution.”

“Therefore, as part of our enhanced counterespionage efforts, there must be far greater scrutiny of anyone from the People’s Republic of China applying for a visa. While the vast majority of Chinese visitors come in peace, there are more than enough secret agents in this bunch to warrant far greater precautions.
Is this “racial profiling”? Absolutely not. It is “country of origin” profiling, and it must be done precisely because China has proven to be the most aggressive nation in the world when it comes to exporting spies to U.S. soil.”

“a more comprehensive cybersecurity policy, and that is all to the good. The cornerstone of this policy must be to treat any state-sponsored cyberattacks as acts of war subject to immediate economic, political, and, if necessary, military retaliation.”

“We also believe that economic restitution to the victims of Chinese hacking must be part of any comprehensive cybersecurity policy. Accordingly, the American Congress, along with the European Union, the Japanese Diet, and other legislative bodies around the world should pass legislation providing for such restitution to citizens, firms, and government agencies that suffer from foreign hacker attacks. To make such restitution meaningful, such legislation should provide for strong mechanisms to attach the assets of companies found to be involved in such cyberhacking”

“it is critical we develop a “China Kill Switch” that can disconnect America’s Internet from all Chinese Internet Protocol addresses in the event of a full-scale cyberwar. But that’s not all. Many Chinese cyberattacks are launched from servers and personal computers outside of China that have been hijacked by the Red Hacker brigades. This means a second-level kill switch is needed that can completely isolate key pieces of our infrastructure—utilities, banks, defense firms—from the Internet entirely.”

“We must also make it clear that America, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, India, and the European Union are not going to continue to look the other way while Beijing’s agents steal our technologies, sabotage our institutions, and prepare for a future apocalyptic cyberwar. If the People’s Republic of China wants to do business with us, it will have to behave like it belongs in the same club of free and fair trading nations.”

“As a first rule, we absolutely must get more “bang for our buck” out of our moribund, cost-plus military industrial complex. The current weapons procurement system creates spectacularly expensive weapons systems that are constantly over budget, always behind schedule, and often trouble-plagued.”

“From a strategic perspective, America’s political and military leaders must also recognize that a cash-flush Beijing would love to put the United States in the same role that the Soviet Union played facing President Ronald Reagan’s America in the 1980s. China, with its trillions of dollars in foreign reserves, booming economy, and rapid militarization, would love to lure a fiscally precarious United States into an arms race that could ultimately break America financially. ”

“the Pentagon should be required to report annually on the ability of the U.S. military to withstand a Chinese air and missile assault on its regional bases and list a set of specific steps that can be taken to survive such an assault. The Commission has also urged our military to “strengthen its interaction with allies in the Western Pacific” and “expand its outreach to other nations in Asia to demonstrate the U.S.’s continued commitment to the region.” Building up strong alliances with three of China’s likely future targets—Japan, India, and Vietnam—represents an important part of this strategy.”

“That’s why ultimately we must come to understand that the best argument for disarming China’s weapons of job destruction is not to “save our jobs”—as important as that might be. Rather, the best argument for confronting China’s unfair trade practices is one of national defense”

“We need to beef up and staff up the institutions that have typically helped the United States project “soft power” around the world. These institutions include government agencies like the Foreign Service, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Peace Corps, and the many branches of the U.S. military that provide services in regions where American forces are deployed.
As part of a revival of U.S. diplomacy, we also need to carefully monitor Chinese activities around the world. Such monitoring must be conducted at the global grassroots; thus, in every one of the almost 300 embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic missions the United States maintains around the world, we should deploy one or more China specialists. More broadly, this focus will help build up a core of China analysts in the American diplomatic and intelligence communities.
Nor should possible corporate contributions to the projection of America’s soft power be overlooked. The fact here is that many American CEOs view themselves as patriots, and we need to engage their firms in getting their operations abroad to act as ambassadors for our nation.”

“The West might also consider ways to actively provide free Internet proxy server services to Chinese citizens. Such services would allow Internet users behind China’s Great Firewall to freely venture into the “real virtual world.””

“Replace French and German with Mandarin in Our High Schools. In fact, Mandarin should be offered beginning in elementary school.”

""Congress should therefore immediately pass legislation to restrict the export of any software or hardware products that may be used by totalitarian regimes to censor the Internet and telecommunications systems.""

""The time has now come to turn the government’s space monopoly over to real private industry and let both civilians and our military benefit from the market forces that have always served our nation well.""

""for private firms to quickly take over the more mundane “space trucking” functions and thereby provide “reliable, routine, access to low Earth orbit.” Delegating these more mundane functions to private enterprise would allow NASA to move back into more exciting exploration challenges. This goal has been backed by President Obama’s budget, which includes $6 billion in additional NASA funds specifically allocated to contracting for private launch services. Congressional efforts to sink this plan, backtrack on privatization, and return NASA to a sleepy socialized jobs program must be stopped!""

""Accordingly, scholarships, student loans, and educational grants should be disproportionately tilted to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math—the so-called STEM subjects""

""That’s why the United States must start laying claim to valuable space resources like the moon while we still have a strong position to do so. We must also start laying out our claims to resource-rich asteroids like Eros and potentially colonizable spots like Ceres, Mars, and the Lagrange points.

[Ref. original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88injx/us_economic_results_4218_4618/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

No official forecast today, but since at least one of you degenerates wants to know about the average hourly earnings report tomorrow, let's add one to the mix.

 |   YoY | Actual | Forecast | Variance
---|---|----|----|----|----
**Average Hourly Earnings (MoM)**|	4/6/2018|		 |0.3 	
8:30 AM EDT	|4/7/2017	 |0.2 	 |0.2 	|0.00%
	|4/1/2016	 |0.3 	 |0.2 	|50.00%
	|4/3/2015	 |0.3 	 |0.2 	|50.00%
	|4/4/2014	 |-   	 |0.2 	|-100.00%
	|			
	|**Last 6 months**			
	|3/9/2018	 |0.1 	 |0.2 	|-50.00%
	|2/2/2018	 |0.3 	 |0.3 	|0.00%
	|1/5/2018	 |0.3 	 |0.3 	|0.00%
	|12/8/2017|	 0.2 	 |0.3 	|-33.33%
	|11/3/2017|	 -   	 |0.2 	|-100.00%
	|10/6/2017|	 0.5 	 |0.3 	|66.67%
	|			
	|**4/6/2018 predicted**	 |**0.2** 	 |**0.3** 	|**-22.22%**

**Methodology:** Too many ""DIV/0"" errors in Excel, using the formula in my original post, so these are just simple averages. Note that the year-over-year results, as well as the results for the last 6 months, come out to 0.2, on average. I'm just going with that. There are also articles floating around that discuss low wage growth, so the most reasonable prediction here is a miss -- which is actually considered a good thing, from the market's perspective.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Green

**ANY REVISIONS?**

[Remember when I warned you guys about Trump?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/trump-orders-consideration-of-100-billion-in-new-china-tariffs) Futures are red already, $SPY is already down $3 and some change, people are going to want to take profits tomorrow, anyway, and I **strongly doubt** that we're going to end the day anything less than **FUCKING RED.**

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

To reiterate the way I do shit: I buy puts when the market goes up, and calls when it goes down. This strategy is fine if you stay the fuck away from weeklies, and don't mind being in the red for 1+ week(s). And don't bet against $TSLA.

[Ref. original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88injx/us_economic_results_4218_4618/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**Forecast**

No forecast for today's releases. My predictions for tomorrow's numbers remain unchanged.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Boring

Results: $SPY was boring for most of the day, but sometime within the last hour of trading, closed up $3.30 (or around 1.27%). Not spectacular, but ultimately, it wasn't as boring as I thought it'd be. I think that means I'm *technically* wrong (the best kind of wrong) about today, but not by much, which makes me feel just that tiny bit better about myself.

**Any revisions?**

As of 9:41 PM EDT on 4/3/18, no revisions yet. The market closed green, there seems to be less overall fear than there was yesterday, and it's looking more likely than not that we'll get some good economic reports tomorrow. There are a couple caveats, however: 

* I'm seeing more talk about markets betting that Trump is all talk and no action. Now that the cat's out of the bag, just wait for Trump to find a way to prove them wrong. So, if we see more talk on this topic tomorrow, expect the mood to sour enough that my guesses for Thursday and/or Friday switch from green to redder than your mom's face when people find out you're her kid. God fucking damn it.

* Tariffs are still swirling around. I don't think there's as much fear as before, and I don't see a good reason to shit my pants right now; however, the topic seems to put the markets on a hair-trigger, so all I can say is keep a close eye on it.

**Anything else?**

I had a date tonight and we totally like each other.

**UPDATE (4/4/18 @ 7:06 AM EDT)**

We're looking at a crazy morning, folks. My tea leaves are too covered in FUD to do any DD right now, but I just want to say: we knew China's retaliatory tariffs were in the pipeline. The initial $3B came with a promise of more to come. This is nothing new. I'm not saying you should hold your bags, but at least in my case, I'm waiting until later today to make a decision.",false,89lgtc,,0,,false,1529545034,false,self,t5_2th52,false,,,false,true,,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/89lgtc/recap_day_2_of_us_economic_results_forecasts/,t3_89lgtc,,,,

This is a short term mean reversion indicator.  

This is named after Larry Conners who suggests that this short term strategy offers positive returns.  
The lower the value of the ConnorsRSI, the higher correlation with positive returns in the following 3 trading days.  Values below 10 generate a buy.  Values below 5 generate a strong buy signal.  Values above 90/95 generate sell and strong sell signals.  

2 entry options:
1. Connors recommended looking for values just before the close, so that you can gain on gap up the following day.  (higher risk)
2. Enter on the open the following day after the signal is generated (lower risk).

As of 7:30 am EST its looking like today will be a red sea of shit, but it’s an overreaction and here’s why:

1. DJT has no interest in engaging in actions that would steer his midwestern swing state voters to the other side of the aisle. If there is one thing this guy loses sleep over, it’s his approval rating in swing states. These voters are his life blood and stand to lose the most in the off chance these tariffs go into effect as is.

2. It’s highly unlikely a trade war will materialize because it benefits neither country. It’s much more likely these announcements are being made as a negotiating tactic to get the other side to cave. Everything you’re seeing from DJT is straight from his book “The Art of the Deal”. Here are a few snippets:

&gt;Use your leverage but contain the costs.


He’s using the big, swinging dick of POTUS leverage. As far as the costs go, the tariffs amount to less than one half of one percent of GDP. 

&gt;Fight back


This is what you see on Twitter every day, and his publicly announced double-downs on Chinese trade policy 


&gt;Have fun


Remember guys, “trade wars are fun, and easy to win”. This statement was a troll and DJT gets off to triggering snowflakes. 

3. Trump just tweeted “we are not in a trade war with China”. Take this for what it’s worth but this isn’t something you state publicly unless you are trying to preserve the opportunity for negotiations. By comparison, if he were to come out and say “I dEcLaRe TrAdE wAr On ChYnA”, all bets are off and negotiations are off the table.

Still some decent bets (I picked up some $9 and $10 AMD calls because I'm a degenerate).

Going to re-run it later today to pick up some results being filtered out by the minimum volume, so keep an eye out for a second sheet in the file later today (I'll move it to the first sheet).

I see there are a couple of upgrades on Lam in already. I’m not surprised.

Am long Micron and musing buying the dip in Lam.

**Prepared Notes:**

- We believe that **content growth remains a powerful multiyear driver of demand in the data economy.** 
- Context for multiyear customer investments is not simply a byproduct of market efficiency.. ..**it is more fundamentally endorsed by the evergreen verticals** of climate change, education, food and water, healthcare, AI, security... etc etc
- 5G networks will drive the need for nearly **2x the DRAM contents in smartphones relative to the current global average.**
- Additionally, density increases associated with higher layer counts in 3D NANDs create the opportunity for **terabyte level storage in smartphones within the next few years**.
- For 2018 **investments by our customers remain prudent and demand led.**
- For NAND and nonvolatile memory broadly the totality of our perspective would be that **long-term demand drivers are compelling.**
- It seems that the perpetual bull-bear debate surrounds the sustainability of memory based investments. In that context, we think it is worthy to note that associated with the emergence of cloud and collectivity, **the 7-year cumulative annual growth rate for memory WFE is 15%, 10x greater than the comparable foundry logic WFE CAGR.**
- **A strong memory business in the new data economy is a sustainable asset** and not a liability from our perspective.
- **We target outperforming overall industry growth again in calendar year 2018**

**Q&amp;A:**

- **Evercore**: ..clearly a lot of debate around sustainability of memory and I was hoping maybe you could help out on the DRAM side.
- **Lan**: …it’s true to say that our customers have never spent more money, it’s also true to say that in many respects they have never spent a smaller proportion of their profits… **pricing stability of DRAM appears there.**

- **Nomura**: .. at what level do you become concerned that your DRAM customers are adding too much capacity?
- **Lan**: I would be concerned that our customers are adding a few much capacity … if end use demand concluded that there was a dramatic imbalance and **we have no evidence of that.**
- …when we look at consensus and then the construct of the market and isolate, for example, a **45% server bit growth assumption in DRAM** … We end up in the same place that our customers are articulating plans.

- **JP Morgan** (this guy fucks): overall DRAM industry capacity has been relatively flattish for the past several years, the market has been getting nervous in the amount of announced DRAM CapEx spend … **but a lot of it is just to offset capacity declines and technology conversion and just to maintain a stable bit supply output**, so wanted to get your views on how much you see total industry capacity going this year?
- **Lan**: 100% agree with what you articulated in terms of the rationale for investments whether tradition or conversion … **we do see a modest increase in capacity in DRAM associated with the driver of demand** … it’s perfectly relevant to the choices that our customers are making … **it appears modest and balanced and rational**.

* 1-month implied volatilities for major Asian index options have shifted from expensive only 2 weeks ago to cheap as of market close in Asia, closing below their 1-year averages.  Skew is now fairly valued to cheap for all major Asia index options.  May 11 OTM Calls and Puts on the Nikkei 225 were the most actively traded options in Tokyo.  OTM April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng China Enterprise and April 27 Call and Puts on the Hang Seng were the most actively traded options in Hong Kong.

**European Options**

* Risk premiums in options markets point to a continued risk-on feel with the VSTOXX continuing its decline, currently at 13.0360 after closing at 13.2880.  The VSTOXX is now back to lows last seen in January 2018.  While Skew for 1-month Euro Stoxx 50 options is very cheap, it has moved up to the 33rd percentile from the 10th percentile based on its 1-year average this morning (from yesterday).  Rising Skew suggests demand for Euro Stoxx 50 OTM Puts is picking up.  Options activity is limited to “macro” trades again today with OTM December 18 Puts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Banks, OTM June 18 Calls and Puts on the Euro Stoxx 50, and OTM April 20 Calls and Puts on the Euro Stoxx 50 are the most actively traded options in Europe.

**US Options**

* US options, pre-market, are implying a continued drop in risk premiums with the VIX currently dropping to 15.06 after closing yesterday at 15.25.  OTM April 20 Calls and Puts on on SPY and OTM May 18 Puts on EEM are the most heavily traded options this morning.

Basically before the last big dip I pressed the wrong button and traded a bunch of AMZN contracts with 4/20 expiry. This was in a condor call spread, not an iron condor.

We don't needa talk about the why, but here's some interesting details.

* At one point the spread was down over 1000%, sorry I didn't screenshot that.

* My max loss was only $400 lol (at expiry, during late march it was like $4000)

* My max gain was $3588

* My max profit was attainable if AMZN landed between $1540-$1560 on 4/20

* AMZN was in the $1300's for a large part of my time holding this, which is why I was underwater 1000%, and had zero hope of getting any money back.

* Schwab fees were like $80 for this dumb ass trade

* I held this terrible position since March 8th. That means I was actually within 1.25% of my initial sweetspot during 41 days of high volatility trading. I consider this a badge of honor. 


Yesterday I started to see a bit of green and closed two spreads outta my four. That way I at least limited my loss a bit instead of losing 100% of my money.

DD inside,"NFLX surged after its earnings call this week.  But who gives a shit if they brought in more subscribers when they are in a total cash burn and facing increased competition from Hulu/Amazon and other streaming services?

Fundamentals: NFLX has $28 billion in outstanding debt.  They're going to spend around $8 billion on programming this year alone.  Meanwhile cash flow is something like 1/100 of that.  Borrowing costs are increasing as cucks at the Fed will keep raising interest rates, and eventually the company will have to scale back spending by offering shittier programming, which will in turn make users drop their subscription (which is constantly becoming more expensive).  Amazon and other streaming services will continue to pose more competition, eventually making NFLX worth nowhere near its current valuation.  

TA: RSI is in the high 60s.  This shit is overbought AF.  

On the other hand, margin costs to short this are increasing because of Fed hikes.  My current margin rate is something like 7%.  So I'm thinking buy puts are the way to go.  Maybe the January 2019 $300 puts for around $26.

Grubhub is an online and mobile food-ordering company that connects diners with local restaurants. Diners use their website or their app to order food from local restaurants, and then Grubhub will deliver the food from the restaurant to the Diners' residence.

Top line relevent data:

- Average Alexa Ranking for Q1 2017: 4401.867
- Average Alexa Ranking for Q1 2018: 2241.78

- Organic Searches in Q1 2017: 6.911m
- Organic Searches in Q1 2018: 13.341m

Grubhub's website rank has halved in the past year, and their organic search hits have increased by 90%.
Reminder that Grubhub's business model is:

- Customer goes on to their website
- Customer buys food

This means that their revenue should be directly proportional to the traffic their website gets. Having your Alexa rank halve from 4400 to 2200 should indicate a traffic increase of 80-90%, and organic searches would seem to confirm this. This doesn't mean that Revenue will go up 80-90%, as not all visits buy something. I would conservatively estimate a revenue increase of 62% to $253m; the street expects a revenue increase of 46.9% to $230m. Also, if you take a look at when the analysts made their predictions, you see that all of them made their predictions a long ass time ago before this data was even finished.

As for the bottom line, know that Grubhub gets the overwhelming majority of its revenue from the United States, with the rest coming from the United Kingdom. This means they should be able to take full advantage of the tax cuts.

--- 

Reasoning + Proof of position:

- Netflix previously reached an ATH on March 5th at $331.44. After it beat its earnings, it surpassed this ATH and hit $336.
- Grubhub's ATH is currently $110.53 reached on Marth 12th. Similar performance after a beat should land it at $112.

Grubhub reports premarket on 5/1, so buy the 5/4 calls.

Positions:

- 2x $102 5/4 Call
- 2x $103 5/4 Call
- 8x $104 5/4 Call
- 2x $105 5/4 Call

For those who don't know, MTCH is Match Group, which owns a bunch of online dating sites, including Tinder. For all the virgins out there, ""dating"" is when you spend time with a girl and pretend to give a shit about her problems in the hopes that she'll touch your penis.

Anyway, it's one of the most heavily shorted stocks out there (20.3 million short out of a float of 49.5 million, which is far higher than even TSLA) despite the inherent lunacy of betting against pussy. The May 18 $50 calls have the highest open interest. What would it take to initiate a short squeeze against this stock? Why are people betting so hard against it when it doesn't even have any competitors? IAC holds 80% of the shares, which some people say is why there is so much shorting, but I don't really understand that argument. I'm too old for any of this shit, so I'm hoping some of you young guns can tell me if Tinder seems like it's growing, stagnant, or what.

Both are passing through clinical trials with positive results. Biggest problem with killing cancer cells is that healthy cells die too, but current results for SRRA's drug show that healthy cells are intact and death to cancer cells happen after only 12 hour of drug administration which is a world of a difference compared to current chemo method. 

Full disclosure, SRRA is only one of the MANY pharmaceuticals that are doing CRISPR.

Other than the science, the company has VERY SOLID financials. No debt, enough cash to last mid 2020, spending decreased last quarter, 67.87% institutional hold (may be outdated), less than 1% short float, their whole management team is filled with only qualified PHD or MDs. No unqualified GED, bachelor, or even masters holding noobs. 

Current market cap is same as the cash on hand. SRRA just went through a public offering so you're buying it at a discount sub $2.25 (offering price). Analyst 12 month target price of a low $4.91 and high at $7.

I found these stats: 
Expected $2.73 a share, and guidance was supposed to be up.

The retailer earned a profit of $194 million, or $1.41 a share, in the quarter, down from $268.7 million, or $1.84 a share, a year earlier. 

The company recorded a $10.5 million tax expense related to the U.S. tax overhaul.

Net sales jumped 5.2% to $3.7 billion, helped by e-commerce growth. Comparable sales fell 0.6%, beating the FactSet estimate that sales would decrease 2.3%.

Excluding the tax impact, the company earned $1.48 a share. Analysts had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.39 a share on $3.68 billion in revenue.

Let's go over the results for ~~today~~ yesterday [Sorry for the delay!]:

**FORECAST**

None

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Red

Results: Boring. $SPY opened at $265.26 and closed at $265.90. 

My record, so far: 7/9.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

No revisions since I'm posting this just a few hours before the markets open today (doesn't seem fair).

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

TPP talks: Trump already Tweeted that he won't accept it as-is, sets his sights on Japan.

Bank earnings reports: Should provide a bit of a boost today, but $WFC seems like it will be a drag, and with all of this political shit going on, I'll be surprised if the markets go up much. 

Syria: Haven't been able to find anything definitive on this, but if I had to guess, we'll get news this afternoon that Trump just leveled a city or some shit. Just in time for him to go play golf.

Mueller: Just another potential catalyst.

I'm in a rush this morning, so I can't flesh out everything with my usual level of detail, but I'll try to make it up to you guys tonight.
